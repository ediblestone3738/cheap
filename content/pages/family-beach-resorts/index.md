## The best beaches for swimming



Beaches are often associated with tranquility, relaxation and soaking up the sun. But for many people, the beach is also the perfect place to take a dip and cool off. If you’re looking for the best beaches for swimming, there are a few things to consider.

First, think about the type of water you prefer. Do you like calm, placid waters or do you prefer waves and surf? If you’re a fan of the latter, you might want to seek out beaches that offer good conditions for surfing or bodyboarding.

Second, consider the temperature of the water. If you’re looking to escape the heat, you might want to find a beach with cooler waters. Conversely, if you’re looking to warm up, you might want to find a beach with warmer waters.

Finally, think about the amenities that are important to you. Do you want a beach that is crowded or do you prefer a more isolated spot? Do you want a beach that has lifeguards on duty or do you feel comfortable swimming without them?

Once you’ve considered all of these factors, you can start your search for the perfect beach. To get you started, we’ve compiled a list of some of the best beaches for swimming around the world.
