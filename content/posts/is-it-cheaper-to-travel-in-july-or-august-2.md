# Is it Cheaper to Travel in July or August?

Traveling can be expensive, especially during the summer months when prices tend to be higher due to increased demand. But if you’re looking to save money on your next trip, you may be wondering if it’s cheaper to travel in July or August. The answer is not so straightforward, as it depends on where you’re going and when you’re traveling.

## When is the Cheapest Time to Travel?

Generally speaking, the cheapest time to travel is from May to early June and late August through mid-October. This is known as the “shoulder season”, and it’s when you’ll find the best international flight deals. The weather is still relatively warm during this time, and you’ll beat the crazy summer crowds.

## What About July and August?

July and August are the peak summer months, and prices tend to be higher due to increased demand. However, if you’re willing to be flexible with your travel dates, you may be able to find some great deals. For example, if you’re looking to fly to Europe, the cheapest flights tend to be in the first week of July and the last week of August.

## Tips for Finding Cheap Flights

If you’re looking to save money on your next trip, here are some tips for finding cheap flights:

- Book your flights in advance. Airlines tend to offer the best prices for flights booked at least two weeks in advance.
- Be flexible with your travel dates. If you’re willing to fly on a Tuesday or Wednesday, you may be able to find some great deals.
- Consider flying to an alternate airport. You may be able to find cheaper flights if you’re willing to fly to an alternate airport.
- Sign up for fare alerts. Many airlines offer fare alerts, which will notify you when prices drop.
- Compare prices. Make sure to compare prices across different airlines and travel sites to get the best deal.

## Conclusion

When it comes to finding the cheapest time to travel, it’s often much cheaper to travel from May to early June and late August through mid-October. This is when you’ll find the best international flight deals and beat the crazy summer crowds. However, if you’re willing to be flexible with your travel dates, you may be able to find some great deals in July and August. Just make sure to book your flights in advance, be flexible with your travel dates, consider flying to an alternate airport, sign up for fare alerts, and compare prices across different airlines and travel sites.
