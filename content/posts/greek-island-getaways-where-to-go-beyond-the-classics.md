Greek Island Getaways: Where to Go Beyond the Classics

The Greek Islands are a world-renowned destination for travelers. The islands offer everything from stunning beaches to picturesque villages, unforgettable sunsets to delicious food. But while the classics like Santorini and Mykonos are rightfully famous, there are plenty of other Greek islands that offer just as much charm and beauty. Here, we've explored a few of the less-visited islands that are perfect for an off-the-beaten-track island getaway.

1\. Folegandros

Folegandros, located in the Cyclades island group, is a small, cozy island known for its charming main village, Chora. Chora is built on the edge of a cliff and offers breathtaking views of the Aegean Sea. It is an ideal destination for those looking for a quiet and romantic getaway.

2\. Serifos

Serifos is another hidden gem in the Cyclades. This island is characterized by its unique, rocky landscape and picturesque beaches. The capital of the island, Chora, offers stunning views of the Aegean Sea and a maze of cobblestone streets that lead to small shops and taverns.

3\. Milos

Milos is an island of contrasts, with stunning beaches and a volcanic landscape that has resulted in the formation of unique natural sites such as the Kleftiko caves. The island is also home to some of Greece's most impressive archaeological sites.

4\. Paxos

Paxos is a small and unspoiled island located in the Ionian Sea. Visitors can spend their days relaxing in secluded beaches or exploring the island's charming villages. The island's natural beauty is enhanced by the olive groves that cover much of the landscape.

5\. Skopelos

Skopelos, situated in the Aegean Sea, is another charming island known for its rustic character and a laid-back atmosphere. Visitors can explore quaint villages, hidden beaches, or hike through the island's rugged terrain, all while enjoying stunning views of the sea.

FAQs:

1.) What is the best time of the year to visit the Greek Islands?

The best time to visit the Greek Islands is during the shoulder seasons of late May to early June or September to early October. During these times, the weather is still warm, and the crowds are smaller, making it easier to explore the islands without being overrun by other tourists.

2.) How do I get around the Greek Islands?

The best way to get around the Greek Islands is by ferry. There are several ferry companies operating across the Greek islands, making it easy to hop from island to island. Some islands also have small airports, but flying can be expensive.

3.) How many days should I spend on each island?

The amount of time you spend on each island depends on your interests and how much time you have. Generally, it's best to spend at least two to three days on each island to get a sense of its character and attractions.
