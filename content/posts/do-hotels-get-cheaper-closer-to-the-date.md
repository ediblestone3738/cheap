# Do Hotels Get Cheaper Closer to the Date?

Are you looking for a great deal on a hotel stay? You may have heard that hotels get cheaper closer to the date. But is this really true? The answer is yes! Hotels are always looking to maximize their occupancy rate, so they often drop their prices a few days before a check-in date or on the day of arrival.

## Why Do Hotels Drop Their Prices?

Hotels are businesses, and like any business, they want to make money. To do this, they need to fill their rooms. If they don't reach their expected occupancy rate, they may lower their prices to attract more customers. This is why you may see prices drop closer to the date.

## How Can You Take Advantage of This?

If you're looking for a great deal on a hotel stay, it pays to be flexible. Try to book your stay a few days before the check-in date, or even on the day of arrival. You may be able to get a much better rate than if you had booked earlier.

## Tips for Finding the Best Deals

If you want to take advantage of lower prices closer to the date, here are some tips to help you find the best deals:

### 1\. Sign Up for Hotel Loyalty Programs

Many hotels offer loyalty programs that give you access to exclusive discounts and offers. Signing up for one of these programs can help you get the best deals on your hotel stays.

### 2\. Follow Hotels on Social Media

Hotels often post special offers and discounts on their social media accounts. Follow your favorite hotels on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to stay up to date on the latest deals.

### 3\. Use a Hotel Price Comparison Site

Hotel price comparison sites can help you find the best deals on hotel stays. They compare prices from multiple hotels, so you can quickly find the best rate.

## Conclusion

Hotels do get cheaper closer to the date. To take advantage of this, try to book your stay a few days before the check-in date or even on the day of arrival. You can also sign up for hotel loyalty programs, follow hotels on social media, and use a hotel price comparison site to find the best deals. With a little bit of research, you can save a lot of money on your next hotel stay.
