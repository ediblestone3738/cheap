Taiwan's Growing Influence in the International Community

Taiwan is a small island nation located in East Asia, known for its vibrant food scene, natural beauty, and cultural diversity. However, in recent years, Taiwan's influence in the international community has been growing, thanks to its proactive foreign policy, economic success, and advancements in technology. This article will explore the reasons why Taiwan's influence is expanding, its relationship with other countries, and the top tourist attractions in the famously hospitable and beautiful nation.

Reasons for Taiwan's Growing Influence

1\. Diplomatic Achievements: Taiwan has been increasingly seeking to expand its international engagement, despite being excluded from the United Nations and other major organizations due to pressure from China. In recent years, Taiwan has managed to achieve greater visibility on the world stage. In 2018, the United States passed the Taiwan Travel Act, allowing high-level diplomatic exchanges between the two countries, despite objections from Beijing. Taiwan has signed free trade agreements with New Zealand and Singapore, and its relationship with Japan has also bolstered.

2\. Economic Success: Taiwan has a highly developed industrialized economy that ranks as the 22nd largest in the world. It exports electronic products, machine parts, and petrochemicals, and boasts mega-corporations like Foxconn and TSMC. Taiwan's prowess in technology has drawn admirers from all over the world, and the government has been working to invest in sustainable infrastructure and cultivate an innovative start-up culture to diversify the economy further.

3\. Soft Power: The term "soft power" refers to the ability of a country to attract and persuade others through its cultural influence rather than coercion. Taiwan has long been known for its vibrant cultural heritage, including traditional puppetry, tea ceremonies, and temples. Additionally, Taiwan's pop-culture industry has been successful in Asia and beyond, with popular television dramas and popular boy-band groups such as F4, which have influenced the culture of the surrounding countries for decades.

Taiwan's Relationship with Other Countries

China: Cross-strait relations between Taiwan and China are complicated, to say the least. In the decades since the Chinese civil war, tensions have remained high, and China has continued to claim Taiwan as part of its territory. However, in recent years, China's increasingly assertive foreign policy has caused concern around the world. Taiwan has been quick to point out that its success as an independent nation shows that democracy and prosperity are possible in the Chinese-speaking world, apart from China's political system.

United States: The United States has had a complex relationship with Taiwan since the end of World War Two. But recent years have shown that the United States intends to continue its support of Taiwan, despite being in the midst of a trade war with China. The US government has also authorized several arms deals to Taiwan that culminated in a significant strategic dialogue that could help counter China's military buildup in the region.
