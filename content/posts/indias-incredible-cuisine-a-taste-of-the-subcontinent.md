From the tandoori chicken of the north to the seafood of the south, the fragrant biryanis of Hyderabad to the rich curries of Punjab, India is a food lover's paradise. Here's a taste of what you can expect when you explore the subcontinent's culinary delights.

The North: A Melting Pot of Flavors

The northern region of India is known for its hearty meat dishes, rich gravies, and delicious flatbreads. Tandoori chicken, a dish made in a clay oven known as a tandoor, is a must-try dish. It is marinated in yogurt and a blend of spices before being cooked over an open flame. Other popular northern dishes include Rogan Josh, a lamb curry made with aromatic spices and Kashmiri red chili, and Butter Chicken, which is chicken cooked in a tomato-based sauce with a generous amount of butter.
