# How Do Hotels Decide Which Room You Get?

When you check into a hotel, you want to be sure that you get the best room possible. But how do hotels decide which room you get? The answer is that it’s the front desk agents who choose a room for you from the available inventory.

## The Front Desk Agents

Front desk agents are the first people you meet when you check into a hotel. They are responsible for checking you in, assigning you a room, and making sure that you have a pleasant stay. They are also the ones who decide which room you get.

## Available Inventory

When you check in, the front desk agent will look at the available inventory of rooms and choose one for you. This inventory includes the type of room, the size, the view, and the amenities. The front desk agent will take all of these factors into consideration when choosing a room for you.

## Asking for a Specific Room

If you have a specific request for a room, you can call the hotel beforehand and ask to speak to a front desk clerk. They will be able to tell you which rooms are available and which ones would be best for you. For example, you may want a corner room, a room on a higher floor, or a room away from the elevators and ice machines.

## Special Requests

If you have any special requests, such as a room with a view or a room with a certain type of bed, you can also ask the front desk clerk. They will do their best to accommodate your requests, but it may not always be possible.

## Conclusion

When you check into a hotel, the front desk agents are the ones who choose a room for you from the available inventory. If you call beforehand, you can talk to a front desk clerk and ask about the best rooms, like corner rooms, a room on a higher floor, away from the elevators and ice machines. You can also make special requests, such as a room with a view or a certain type of bed. The front desk agents will do their best to accommodate your requests, but it may not always be possible.
