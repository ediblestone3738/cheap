Saudi Arabia has long been known for its strict adherence to traditional forms of Islam, but recent years have seen significant progress in women's rights. From the lifting of the ban on women driving to increased participation in politics and business, Saudi Arabia is making strides towards gender equality. This article will explore the progress being made for women's rights in Saudi Arabia, as well as the top 10 tourist attractions in the country.

The Progress of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia

For decades, women in Saudi Arabia had limited rights and freedoms, from the wearing of the abaya (a long, black cloak) to strict gender segregation. However, in recent years, the country has taken significant steps towards granting greater freedoms and rights to women.

Driving

One of the most significant changes came in 2018 when the driving ban on women was lifted. Prior to this, women in Saudi Arabia were not allowed to drive and had to rely on male relatives or paid drivers for transportation. At the time, the lifting of the ban was seen as a major shift in the country's attitude towards women's rights.

Participation in Politics and Business

Another area where women's rights have been expanding in Saudi Arabia is in politics and business. In 2015, women were allowed to run and vote in municipal elections, and in 2019, women were allowed to travel abroad without the permission of a male guardian. Additionally, the country is actively trying to increase the number of women in the workforce, with a goal of reaching 30% by 2030.

Education

Education is another key area where women's rights have been expanding in Saudi Arabia. In recent years, more women have been enrolling in universities, and in 2019, women were allowed to study law and work in the field of family law. Additionally, the country has been investing in programs to support literacy and education for women, with a focus on improving access to education in rural areas.
