# Is it Cheaper to Travel in July or August?

The summer months of July and August are the most popular times to travel. But is it cheaper to travel in July or August? The answer is not as straightforward as you might think. While there are some great deals to be had in July and August, the best time to travel for the best deals is actually the “shoulder season” from May to early June and late August through mid-October.

## The Benefits of Shoulder Season Travel

The shoulder season is the time between the peak travel season and the off-season. It’s often much cheaper to travel during this time because there are fewer people traveling and the demand for flights and accommodations is lower. This is when we find the best international flight deals!

The weather is still relatively warm during the shoulder season, so you won’t have to worry about cold temperatures. And you’ll beat the crazy summer crowds, which means less stress and more time to enjoy your vacation.

## Finding the Best Deals

If you’re looking for the best deals on flights and accommodations, it pays to be flexible. The earlier you book, the better the deals you’ll find. And if you’re willing to be flexible with your dates, you can often find even better deals.

It’s also a good idea to compare prices between different airlines and accommodations. Prices can vary greatly, so it pays to shop around. You can also sign up for airline and hotel loyalty programs to get access to exclusive deals and discounts.

## When to Travel

If you’re looking for the best deals on flights and accommodations, the best time to travel is from May to early June and late August through mid-October. This is when you’ll find the best international flight deals and the lowest prices on accommodations.

But if you’re looking for a summer vacation, July and August are still great times to travel. You just have to be willing to pay a bit more for flights and accommodations. And if you’re willing to be flexible with your dates, you can still find some great deals.

## Conclusion

So is it cheaper to travel in July or August? The answer is not as straightforward as you might think. While there are some great deals to be had in July and August, the best time to travel for the best deals is actually the “shoulder season” from May to early June and late August through mid-October. The weather is still relatively warm during the shoulder season, and you’ll beat the crazy summer crowds. This is when we find the best international flight deals!

No matter when you decide to travel, the key to finding the best deals is to be flexible with your dates and shop around for the best prices. With a bit of planning and research, you can find great deals on flights and accommodations, no matter what time of year you decide to travel.
