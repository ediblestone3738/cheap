Greece is one of the world’s most iconic and beautiful travel destinations. With its rich history, stunning islands, turquoise waters, and ancient ruins, travelers who visit Greece are immediately enchanted by the country’s unique charm. While many tourists stick to visiting the bigger islands like Santorini or Mykonos, there are a myriad of hidden gems waiting to be discovered off the beaten path. On an island-hopping holiday in Greece, a traveler can uncover a whole new world of adventure and beauty.

Getting To Know Greece’s Hidden Gems On An Island Hopping Holiday

An island-hopping holiday in Greece provides the perfect opportunity for travelers to experience the country’s fascinating culture and profound history. Greece is made up of over 6,000 small and large islands, each with its own unique charm, landscape, and culture. While it might seem overwhelming to decide which islands to visit, Greece’s proximity to one another makes it easy to hop from one island to another.

Start the trip by flying into Athens, the capital of Greece. Spend a few days soaking up the city’s history and visiting famous landmarks such as the Acropolis and the Parthenon. There are plenty of hotels and hostels available in Athens to fit all budgets.

From Athens, head to the mythical island of Crete. Crete is the biggest island in Greece, and its rugged mountains, extreme ravines, and deep gorges make it a popular destination for hikers and adventure seekers. The island is also rich in history, with ancient ruins such as the Palace of Knossos. Crete is also home to some of the best beaches in Greece, including Elafonissi and Balos.

Next, head to the charming island of Naxos. Naxos is one of the lesser-known islands in the Cyclades, but it is no less stunning than its more popular counterparts. The island is known for its picturesque villages, beautiful beaches, and ancient ruins. The temple of Apollo and the Sanctuary of Demeter are must-visit sites on this island.

Another hidden gem is the island of Folegandros. This island is known for its stunning landscapes and small, traditional villages. The island is relatively untouched by tourism, which makes it a perfect destination for travelers who want to experience Greece without the crowds. Must-visit spots on this island include the villages of Chora and Ano Meria.

Last but not least, pay a visit to the island of Milos, located in the southwestern part of the Cyclades. Milos is renowned for its beaches, stunning landscapes, and fascinating history. The island is known for its volcanic rock formations, which create a remarkable landscape. Must visit beaches include the Sarakiniko Beach and Pollonia Beach.
