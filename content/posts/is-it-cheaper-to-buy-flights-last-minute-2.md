# Is it Cheaper to Buy Flights Last Minute?

As a travel expert, I often get asked if it’s cheaper to buy flights last minute. The answer is no, it’s not cheaper to book a flight at the last minute. While there used to be occasional fares so low that they might have induced shock, that’s no longer the case.

## Why Last Minute Flights Are Not Cheaper

The reason why last minute flights are not cheaper is because airlines are aware that people are willing to pay more for last minute tickets. Airlines will often raise prices for last minute tickets because they know that people are willing to pay more for the convenience of not having to plan ahead.

Another reason why last minute flights are not cheaper is because airlines are more likely to overbook flights. When a flight is overbooked, the airline will offer incentives to passengers who are willing to take a later flight. These incentives often come in the form of vouchers, which can be used towards future flights. This means that the airline is able to fill the flight and make more money, while the passenger gets a discounted flight.

## When to Buy Last Minute Flights

While it’s generally not cheaper to buy last minute flights, there are certain situations when it can be beneficial. For example, if you’re traveling on a budget and you’re flexible with your travel dates, you may be able to find a last minute flight that’s cheaper than a flight booked in advance.

Another situation when it may be beneficial to buy a last minute flight is if you’re traveling for a special occasion. If you’re traveling for a wedding, for example, you may be able to find a last minute flight that’s cheaper than a flight booked in advance.

## Tips for Finding Last Minute Flights

If you’re looking for last minute flights, there are a few tips that can help you find the best deals. First, make sure to sign up for email alerts from airlines and travel sites. This way, you’ll be the first to know about any last minute deals.

Second, use a flight search engine to compare prices. This will allow you to quickly and easily compare prices from different airlines and travel sites.

Finally, be flexible with your travel dates. If you’re willing to be flexible with your travel dates, you may be able to find a cheaper flight.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, it’s generally not cheaper to buy flights last minute. However, there are certain situations when it can be beneficial to buy a last minute flight. If you’re looking for last minute flights, make sure to sign up for email alerts, use a flight search engine to compare prices, and be flexible with your travel dates.
