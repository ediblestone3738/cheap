Delight in the Splendor of Rome with Our Top City Break Tips

Rome is undoubtedly one of the most captivating cities in the world. Steeped in history, culture and romance, it is a destination that leaves an indelible impression on anyone who visits. Whether you are here for a long or a short stay, Rome has something for everyone. From ancient ruins and grand monuments to world-class museums and vibrant neighborhoods, there is so much to explore and enjoy in this city.

To make the most of your visit to Rome, here are our top city break tips:

1\. Time your visit strategically
Rome can be hot and crowded during peak tourist season (June-August). If you have the flexibility to plan your visit during the shoulder season (April-June or September-October), you'll be able to enjoy the city's attractions with more breathing space, fewer crowds, and more affordable prices.

2\. Get the City Pass
The City Pass is a must-have for anyone visiting Rome. It gives you access to some of the city's top attractions, including the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and the Vatican Museums, while also allowing you to skip the long lines.

3\. Take a guided tour
Rome is a city that demands a lot of walking, and it can be overwhelming to navigate its maze-like streets and alleys. A guided tour with a knowledgeable guide can help you make the most out of your visit by pointing out highlights and providing interesting insights into the city's history and culture.

4\. Watch the sunset from the top of a hill
Rome is situated on seven hills, and each of them offers a stunning view of the city's skyline. The Janiculum hill, for example, is a popular spot for locals to watch the sunset. From the top, you'll be able to enjoy panoramic views of the city, including the dome of St. Peter's Basilica.

5\. Indulge in Italian cuisine
Rome is home to some of the world's most delectable food, and there's something for everyone, regardless of your dietary restrictions. From traditional dishes like pasta carbonara and cacio e pepe to mouth-watering gelato and coffee, you'll be spoilt for choice. Our recommendation is to wander around Trastevere and find a restaurant that catches your eye.

6\. Explore the lesser-known neighborhoods
Tourists tend to stick to the same areas of the city, but Rome has so much more to offer beyond the well-trodden paths. Head to the neighborhoods of Pigneto or Monti and experience a different side of Rome, away from the masses. You'll find quirky shops and cafes, street art, and vibrant nightlife.

7\. Visit the Vatican early in the morning
The Vatican is an unmissable attraction for anyone visiting Rome, but it can be very crowded, making it hard to appreciate the art and architecture. Arrive early (before 10 am) to avoid long queues and enjoy the museum without the hordes of tourists.

8\. Take a day trip to Pompeii
Visitors to Rome can also take an excursion to the ancient city of Pompeii, which was buried under volcanic ash for nearly two millennia. A guided tour of the ruins is a fascinating way to learn about ancient Roman life and see how the city was preserved after its destruction by Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.

9\. Rent a bike in Villa Borghese
If you're looking for a break from the hustle and bustle of the city, head to the tranquil Villa Borghese, a beautiful park in the heart of Rome. There, you can rent a bike and cycle around the park, taking in the views of the lake and gardens.

10\. Attend a performance at the Teatro dell'Opera
The Teatro dell'Opera is one of the most prestigious venues for opera and ballet in Italy. If you're a fan of the arts, don't miss your chance to attend a performance here. The theater is housed in a beautiful building and offers an unforgettable experience.
