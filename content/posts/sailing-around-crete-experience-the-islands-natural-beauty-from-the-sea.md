Sailing around Crete: Experience the Island's Natural Beauty from the Sea

Cruises around the Mediterranean are popular, but nothing beats the experience of sailing around Crete. The island is regarded as one of the largest in Greece, blessed with a long coastline, natural beauty and variety of landscapes. Exploring the island from the sea provides a different perspective, allowing visitors to see a side of Crete that few get to experience.

Sailing around Crete provides unique views of both the majestic Teal-blue Cretan Sea and the impressive island coastline, which reveals nature in all its glory. The scattered secluded coves are perfect for lone sails, and the little harbours and fishing villages along the coast all offer something special. Here is why sailing around Crete should be on your travel itinerary.

Nature at its Finest

If you want to experience natural beauty, then sailing around Crete offers an ideal opportunity. The island is home to numerous beaches that look magnificent from the land. However, the scenery from the water is breath-taking, with the vivid blue of the sea contrasting with the golden sand. The natural beauty extends to the islands, tiny coves, and turquoise waters that provide stunning views. The backdrop of barren mountains, rising rock formations, and wildlife on display go to show how pristine the natural environment is.

A Peaceful and Serene Experience

Sailing around Crete offers visitors a tranquil and peaceful experience. The soothing sound of the gentle sea breeze, the feeling of the warm sun, and the sailboat's gentle motion create a calming atmosphere. This means that one can relax and unwind while catching the panoramic views of the Cretan coastline, all from the safety of a sailboat.

Discover Unknown Beach Coves

One of the perks of sailing around Crete is discovering secluded beach coves you never even knew existed. You get to find islands, little nooks, and crannies that are off the beaten track, and as such, they offer a more private and secluded experience. The rocky coastline and the tiny bays can only be accessed from the sea, making them more elusive and special.

Spectacular Sunsets and Sunrises

Sailing around Crete offers the perfect opportunity to view spectacular sunsets and sunrises. Watching the sun slowly dip into the blue horizon, casting hues of orange, reds and pinks, is an unforgettable experience. Similarly, enjoying the sunrise from the comfort of a sailboat while listening to the gentle sounds of the sea is supremely tranquil.
