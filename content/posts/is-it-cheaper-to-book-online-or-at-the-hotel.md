# Is it Cheaper to Book Online or at the Hotel?

Booking a hotel room can be a tricky process. You want to get the best deal possible, but you also want to make sure you get the best room available. So, is it cheaper to book online or at the hotel?

## Booking in Advance

On average, the same-day rate of a [hotel room is 10% cheaper](/uncategorized/is-it-cheaper-to-upgrade-to-all-inclusive-at-the-hotel/ "Is it cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel?") than booking in advance. This is because hotels are more likely to offer discounts for those who book in advance. This allows them to plan ahead and fill their rooms more efficiently.

However, if you're traveling to a busy tourist city or a town where a large event is happening, don't rely on this strategy. Most people book rooms well in advance, so you may not be able to get the same discounts.

## Booking Online

Booking online is often the most convenient way to book a hotel room. You can easily compare prices, read reviews, and check availability. Plus, you can often find great deals and discounts.

For example, many online travel sites offer exclusive discounts for members. You can also find deals on sites like Groupon and LivingSocial. These sites often offer discounts of up to 50% off the regular rate.

## Booking at the Hotel

Booking at the hotel is another option. You can often get a better deal if you call the hotel directly. The staff may be able to offer you a better rate than what is available online.

You can also ask about any special offers or discounts. Hotels often offer discounts for AAA members, military personnel, and senior citizens.

## The Bottom Line

When it comes to booking a hotel room, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. It really depends on your individual needs and budget.

If you're looking for the best deal, it's usually best to book in advance. However, if you're traveling to a busy tourist city or a town where a large event is happening, don't rely on this strategy. Most people book rooms well in advance, so you may not be able to get the same discounts.
