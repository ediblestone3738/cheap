Crete is one of the most popular destinations in Greece, thanks to its fabulous scenery, breathtaking beaches, and picturesque villages. However, not all of the resorts on the island are equal, and some of them may disappoint you. In this article, we will take a closer look at the ugly truth about Crete's most disappointing resorts and suggest some tourist attractions that might still make your trip worthwhile.

The Ugly Truth About Crete's Most Disappointing Resorts

1\. Malia

Malia is one of the most famous resorts in Crete, primarily because of its lively nightlife. However, it is also infamous for its wild party atmosphere, which might not be everyone's cup of tea. Moreover, the place is often overcrowded, noisy, and rowdy, which can be overwhelming for families or those looking for a peaceful vacation.

2\. Hersonissos

Hersonissos is another tourist magnet on Crete, known for its sandy beaches and restaurants. However, with its fast-food chains, pumping music, and neon-lit streets, it can feel too generic and artificial for some travelers.

It can be challenging to find a local touch in the resort, making it feel like you are not in Greece at all.

4\. Rethymno

Rethymno is a beautiful and historic city on Crete, with charming streets, handsome architecture, and a Venetian Fortress. However, the city is often crowded with tourists; the old town can feel like an open-air museum, with souvenir shops and tavernas lining the streets. Moreover, the beach close to Rethymno is often overcrowded and can be challenging to navigate through.

5\. Balos Beach

Balos Beach is a stunning beach located in the northwest of Crete, with turquoise waters and a lagoon. However, the beach is notoriously overcrowded, and the access road is challenging to navigate. Also, the beach is often littered with trash and debris, ruining its natural charm.
