Street food markets, especially in Tallinn and Tartu, also offer a variety of affordable and tasty options.

### Transportation

Getting around Estonia is both easy and affordable. The country has a well-developed public transportation system, including buses, trams, and trains, with reasonable fares.

#### Kaali Meteorite Crater: Estonia holiday adventures

The Kaali Meteorite Crater is one of Estonia’s most fascinating natural landmarks and a must-visit destination for anyone interested in geology, history, or mythology. Located on the island of Saaremaa, approximately 18 kilometers from the town of Kuressaare, this remarkable site offers a unique glimpse into the cosmic events that have shaped our planet.

##### The Formation of the Crater

The Kaali Crater was formed around 4,000 years ago when a massive meteorite, estimated to weigh between 20 to 80 tons, entered the Earth’s atmosphere. As it hurtled towards the surface at a speed of approximately 20 kilometers per second, the meteorite fragmented into several pieces. The largest of these fragments created the main crater, which has a diameter of about 110 meters and a depth of 22 meters. Surrounding the main crater are eight smaller craters, formed by the smaller fragments of the meteorite.

##### Geological and Archaeological Significance

The Kaali Crater is one of the best-preserved meteorite impact sites in the world and the only known impact site in Europe associated with human habitation. The explosion released an immense amount of energy, estimated to be equivalent to that of a small nuclear bomb. This catastrophic event would have had significant effects on the local environment and possibly on the people living in the area at the time.

Archaeological excavations around the crater have revealed evidence of human activity dating back to the Bronze Age. Researchers have found remnants of ancient fortifications and artifacts, suggesting that the site may have held special significance for the people who lived there. Some theories propose that the crater was used as a sacred site or a place of worship, possibly linked to ancient fire and sun rituals.

##### Myths and Legends

The dramatic impact of the Kaali meteorite has inspired numerous myths and legends. Local folklore often describes the event as a divine or supernatural occurrence. One popular legend tells of the sun falling from the sky, creating a fiery pit that cooled to form the crater we see today. Such stories have been passed down through generations, adding a layer of cultural significance to the geological wonder.

##### Visiting the Kaali Crater

Today, the Kaali Crater is a protected site and a popular tourist attraction. Visitors can explore the main crater, which now holds a small lake at its center. The surrounding area is equipped with informative displays that provide insights into the crater’s formation, the impact event, and its significance in both scientific and cultural contexts. A nearby visitor center and museum offer additional exhibits and educational materials, making the Kaali Crater a comprehensive experience for all ages.

In summary, the Kaali Meteorite Crater is not just a geological marvel but also a window into the ancient past, blending natural history with human culture. It stands as a testament to the powerful forces of nature and the enduring stories that they inspire. A visit to this site on your journey through Estonia will undoubtedly leave you with a deeper appreciation for the mysteries of our planet and the universe beyond.
