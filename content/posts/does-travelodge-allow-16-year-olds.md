# Does Travelodge Allow 16 Year Olds?

As a travel expert, I often get asked if Travelodge allows 16 year olds to stay in their hotels. The answer is yes, but there are a few conditions that need to be met.

## Making a Booking

Travelodge allows 16 year olds to make a booking, but only if they are 16 years old or over. This means that if you are under 16, you will not be able to make a booking on your own.

## Staying Alone

If you are 16 years old or over, you can make a booking and stay in a Travelodge hotel. However, if you arrive at the hotel and are under 16 years of age, you will not be permitted to stay alone. This means that if you are under 16, you will need to be accompanied by an adult over the age of 18.

## Age Restrictions

Travelodge has an age restriction policy in place to ensure the safety of all guests. The policy states that anyone under the age of 16 must be accompanied by an adult over the age of 18. This policy was put in place in March 2012 and applies to all Travelodge hotels.

## What to Bring

If you are 16 years old or over and making a booking at a Travelodge hotel, you will need to bring a valid form of identification. This could be a passport, driver’s license, or other government-issued ID. This is to ensure that you are of legal age to stay in the hotel.

## Conclusion

Travelodge does allow 16 year olds to stay in their hotels, but there are some conditions that need to be met. You must be 16 years old or over to make a booking, and if you are under 16 you must be accompanied by an adult over the age of 18. You will also need to bring a valid form of identification to prove your age.

Overall, Travelodge is a great option for 16 year olds who are looking for a place to stay. With its age restriction policy in place, you can be sure that you will be safe and secure while staying at a Travelodge hotel.
