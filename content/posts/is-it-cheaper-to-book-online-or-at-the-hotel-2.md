# Is it Cheaper to Book Online or at the Hotel?

Traveling can be expensive, and one of the biggest expenses is usually accommodation. If you’re looking to save money on your next trip, you may be wondering if it’s cheaper to book online or at the hotel. The answer is not as straightforward as you might think.

## Booking Online

Booking online is often the most convenient way to book a hotel room. You can compare prices across different sites, read reviews, and find the best deal. Plus, you can often get discounts or other perks when you book online.

## Booking at the Hotel

Booking at the hotel can also be a great way to save money. On average, the same-day rate of a [hotel room is 10% cheaper](/uncategorized/is-it-cheaper-to-upgrade-to-all-inclusive-at-the-hotel/ "Is it cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel?") than booking in advance. However, this strategy doesn’t always work. If you’re traveling to a busy tourist city or a town where a large event is happening, you’re unlikely to find a room at a discounted rate. Most people book rooms well in advance.

## Other Ways to Save Money

If you’re looking to save money on your hotel room, there are a few other strategies you can try. For example, you can try to negotiate a better rate. Hotels are often willing to offer discounts to customers who are willing to pay in cash or who are staying for an extended period of time.

You can also look for special offers or discounts. Many hotels offer discounts for AAA members, seniors, or military personnel. You can also look for special promotions or discounts that are available on certain days of the week or during certain times of the year.

## Conclusion

When it comes to booking a hotel room, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. On average, the same-day rate of a [hotel room is 10% cheaper](/uncategorized/is-it-cheaper-to-upgrade-to-all-inclusive-at-the-hotel-2/ "Is it cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel?") than booking in advance. However, this strategy doesn’t always work. If you’re traveling to a busy tourist city or a town where a large event is happening, you’re unlikely to find a room at a discounted rate.

There are other ways to save money on your hotel room, such as negotiating a better rate or looking for special offers or discounts. Ultimately, the best way to save money on your hotel room is to do your research and compare prices across different sites.

Happy travels!
