Taiwan Emerges as a Model of Democracy in the Asia-Pacific Region

Taiwan, a small island located off the coast of China, has emerged as a model of democracy in the Asia-Pacific region.

It was the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage, and has a strong record of protecting freedom of the press and freedom of speech. Taiwan also abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 2020, becoming the first country in Asia to do so.
