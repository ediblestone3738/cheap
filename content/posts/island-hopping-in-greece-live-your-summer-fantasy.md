Island-Hopping in Greece: Live Your Summer Fantasy

Greece is a dream destination for many travelers, and island-hopping is a perfect way to get a glimpse of the enchanting Greek lifestyle. There are over 6,000 islands scattered around Greece, but only about 200 of them are inhabited, offering endless possibilities for island exploration.

Island-hopping is a popular activity among tourists, and for good reason. The experience of hopping from one island to another is unparalleled, and each island has its own unique charm, culture, and beauty. The crystal-clear waters surrounded by stunning scenery, gorgeous beaches, delicious Greek cuisine, and rich history make Greece an ideal destination for island-hopping.

Island-Hopping: A Guide

The essential aspect of island-hopping is transportation. There are two primary methods of transportation in Greece - ferries or flights. Ferries are the most popular mode of transportation for island-hopping in Greece. There are various ferry companies that operate in Greece, including Blue Star Ferries, Seajets, and Hellenic Seaways. They offer different types of ferries such as high speed, conventional or car ferries. The cost for the ferry ticket varies based on the type of ferry and the distance between the two islands. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak season, to ensure that you get the tickets you want. Schedules and routes of ferries can be easily found on their respective websites.

Flights are an option as well, but they are more expensive compared to ferries. Aegean Airlines and Olympic Airlines are two major airlines that operate domestic flights within Greece. Flights are available between the major cities within Greece as well as some of the popular islands. However, it is recommended to avoid flights to minimize the carbon footprint of our trips.

The best time to go island-hopping in Greece is from April to mid-June or from mid-September to October. During this period, the weather is comfortable, and the crowds are less than during peak season. July and August are the busiest months, where the temperatures can soar in the high thirties, and you might have to share your favorite spot with other tourists.
