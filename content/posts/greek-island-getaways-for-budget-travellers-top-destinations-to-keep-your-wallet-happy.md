Greece is known for its stunning landscapes, turquoise waters, incredible history, and incredible cuisine. It's no wonder that Greek Island getaways are at the top of many travelers' bucket lists. However, with popular destinations like Santorini and Mykonos, it can be easy for budget travelers to feel as if this dream vacation is out of reach.

Thankfully, there are many Greek island getaways that are friendly to budget travelers, where you can still get the full experience of what Greece has to offer without breaking the bank. From sandy beaches to idyllic villages, here are some of the top Greek island getaways that will keep your wallet happy.

1\. Naxos
Naxos, the largest of the Cyclades islands, is an excellent destination for budget travelers. This island has the best of both worlds – beautiful beaches and picturesque villages. While some parts of the island can certainly get touristy, it's still possible to find affordable accommodation and food. In terms of attractions, the Temple of Apollo and the Portara (the giant marble gate that belongs to an unfinished temple of Apollo) are must-sees.

Crete is the largest of the Greek islands and is famous for its history and culture. Despite its size, Crete is a budget-friendly destination. There are plenty of affordable accommodations and delicious local food. Be sure to visit Chania, a beautiful old town filled with Venetian architecture and winding streets. Other attractions include Knossos Palace, the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete, and Samaria Gorge, a stunning natural park with hiking trails.

The town is filled with cobblestone streets, stunning architecture, and plenty of cafés and restaurants. For attractions, there's the Hydra Museum Historical Archives, where you can learn about the island's history, and the Hydra Cathedral, a beautiful church with stunning frescoes.

4\. Paros
Paros is a Cycladic island that is often overshadowed by its more popular neighbors, Mykonos and Santorini. However, it's one of the best Greek island getaways that won't break the bank. It has stunning beaches, charming villages, and plenty of opportunities for water sports. A must-visit is the small fishing village of Naoussa, known for its traditional architecture and picturesque harbor.

5\. Milos
Milos is one of the lesser-known Greek islands and is a haven for budget travelers. It was formed by volcanic activity and has a unique landscape, including stunning beaches and rugged cliffs. The island is famous for its seafood, particularly its octopus. For attractions, visit the Ancient Roman Theatre and the Milos Mining Museum, where you can learn about the island's mining history.
