# What is the Maximum Amount of Days You Can Stay in a Hotel?

Hotels and motels are a great way to stay when you’re travelling. Whether you’re on vacation or business, you can find a hotel or motel that fits your needs. But how long can you stay in a hotel or motel? The answer depends on the hotel’s policy.

## Hotel Policies on Maximum Stay

Under hotel policy, guests at a residential hotel may stay at the hotel for months or years at a time so long as they leave their unit for 24 hours every 28 days. This is to avoid the guest becoming a permanent resident. California hotels and motels believe that by kicking out a guest for 24 hours before the guest stays for 30 consecutive days, they avoid the guest becoming a permanent resident.

## What Are the Benefits of Long-Term Hotel Stays?

There are many benefits to staying in a hotel for a longer period of time. One of the main benefits is the cost savings. Hotels often offer discounts for long-term stays, which can save you money in the long run. Additionally, you can often find hotels that offer amenities such as free breakfast, free Wi-Fi, and more.

## What Are the Disadvantages of Long-Term Hotel Stays?

While there are many benefits to staying in a hotel for a longer period of time, there are also some disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is the lack of privacy. Hotels can be noisy and busy, and it can be difficult to find a quiet place to relax. Additionally, you may not have access to a kitchen or other amenities that you would have in a long-term rental.

## Tips for Long-Term Hotel Stays

If you’re planning on staying in a hotel for a longer period of time, there are a few tips that can help make your stay more enjoyable. First, make sure to book a room with a kitchenette or other amenities that you may need. This will help you save money on meals and other necessities. Additionally, make sure to ask the hotel staff about any discounts they may offer for long-term stays.
