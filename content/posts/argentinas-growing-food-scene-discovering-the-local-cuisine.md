The Best of Argentine Cuisine:

When it comes to Argentine cuisine, meat is king. Argentina is famous for its asado (barbecue), and you won't find better quality beef anywhere else in the world. The cows are fed on grass and roam freely on the vast pampas, resulting in incredibly flavorful meat. The most popular cuts are bife de chorizo (sirloin steak), asado de tira (short ribs), and vacio (flank steak). These are often grilled over an open flame, and served with chimichurri, a tangy sauce made from parsley, garlic, and vinegar.

Another must-try dish is empanadas, savory pastries filled with various meats, vegetables, and spices. They are a popular street food and can be found almost anywhere in Argentina. Try them with a glass of Argentine wine for the full experience.

If you have a sweet tooth, you can't leave Argentina without trying dulce de leche, a caramel-like spread made from condensed milk. It's used in many desserts, including alfajores, two shortbread cookies filled with dulce de leche.

Argentine Beverages to Try:

Argentina is famous for its wine, and with good reason. The country has some of the best wine regions in the world, including Mendoza and Salta. Malbec is the most famous grape variety, but be sure to also try Torrontes, a white wine with floral and fruity notes.
