# How Many Days in Advance is the Cheapest to Book a Flight?

Traveling by air is often the most convenient and fastest way to get from one place to another. However, the cost of airfare can be a major factor when planning a trip. Fortunately, there are ways to save money on flights, such as booking in advance. But how far in advance should you book to get the best deal?

## When is the Best Time to Book a Flight?

According to CheapAir.com, the best time to book a flight is between 95 and 21 days before the flight. This is roughly three months to three weeks before the flight. During this time, prices will slowly creep downward until they reach their lowest point. After this, you will likely see a last-minute spike in cost.

## Why Book in Advance?

Booking in advance is a great way to save money on flights. Airlines often offer discounts to those who book their flights early. This is because airlines are able to plan ahead and can better predict how many seats will be filled on a flight. The earlier you book, the more likely you are to get a discounted rate.

## Tips for Booking Flights in Advance

When booking a flight in advance, there are a few tips to keep in mind:

- Sign up for airline newsletters. Airlines often send out emails with special offers and discounts. These can be a great way to save money on flights.
- Compare prices. Don’t just book the first flight you find. Compare prices from different airlines to make sure you’re getting the best deal.
- Be flexible. If you’re willing to be flexible with your travel dates, you may be able to find cheaper flights.
- Check for hidden fees. Some airlines charge extra fees for baggage, seat selection, and other services. Make sure to read the fine print before booking.

## Conclusion

Booking a flight in advance is a great way to save money. According to CheapAir.com, the best time to book a flight is between 95 and 21 days before the flight. This is roughly three months to three weeks before the flight. By following the tips above, you can make sure you’re getting the best deal on your flight.
