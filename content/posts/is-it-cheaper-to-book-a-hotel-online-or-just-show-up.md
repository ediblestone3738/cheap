# Is it Cheaper to Book a Hotel Online or Just Show Up?

Are you looking for a great deal on a hotel room? Many travelers are always looking for ways to save money on their accommodations. One way to save money is to wait until the day you need the hotel room to book it. The later in the day, the better. On average, the same-day rate of a hotel room is 10% cheaper than booking in advance.

## Why is it Cheaper to Book a Hotel Room on the Same Day?

Hotels know the odds of selling a room are pretty slim after 4 p.m., so they are more likely to offer a lower rate. This is because hotels would rather make some money on a room than have it sit empty. Hotels also offer discounted rates for same-day bookings to fill up rooms that have been canceled.

## How to Find the Best Deals on Same-Day Hotel Bookings

If you are looking for the best deals on same-day hotel bookings, there are a few things you can do. First, you should always check the hotel's website for any special offers or discounts. Many hotels offer discounts for same-day bookings, so it is worth checking out. You can also check online travel sites like Expedia or Hotels.com for discounted rates.

## When is the Best Time to Book a Hotel Room?

The best time to book a hotel room is usually the day before you need it. This will give you the best chance of getting a discounted rate. However, if you are flexible with your travel dates, you can often find great deals by booking a few days in advance.

## What are the Benefits of Booking a Hotel Room Online?

Booking a hotel room online has many benefits. First, it is much more convenient than calling the hotel directly. You can easily compare prices and amenities from different hotels in one place. You can also read reviews from other travelers to help you make an informed decision. Additionally, many online travel sites offer discounts and special offers that you won't find if you book directly with the hotel.

## Conclusion

Booking a hotel room online or just showing up can both be great ways to save money. If you are looking for the best deals, it is usually best to wait until the day you need the hotel room to book it. After 4 p.m., hotels know the odds of selling a room are pretty slim, so you're more likely to get an even lower rate. Additionally, you can often find great deals by booking a few days in advance. Finally, booking a hotel room online has many benefits, such as convenience, price comparison, and access to discounts and special offers.
