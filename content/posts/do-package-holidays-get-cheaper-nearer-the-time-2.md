# Do Package Holidays Get Cheaper Nearer the Time?

As a travel expert, I am often asked if package holidays get cheaper nearer the time. The answer is yes, but it is important to know when to book for the best deals.

## When to Book for the Best Deals

Usually, it's best to book late for the best deals. This means no more than 8-10 weeks before departure, when the bargains flood in. Airlines and tour operators are often willing to discount their prices in order to fill up their flights and packages.

## Why Do Prices Drop?

There are a few reasons why prices drop nearer the time. Airlines and tour operators may be struggling to fill up their flights and packages, so they offer discounts to encourage more people to book. They may also be trying to compete with other airlines and tour operators, so they offer discounts to attract more customers.

## Tips for Booking Late

When booking late, it is important to be flexible with your travel dates. This will give you more options and increase your chances of finding a great deal. It is also important to be flexible with your destination. You may find a great deal to a destination you hadn't considered before.

It is also important to be aware of the risks of booking late. You may not be able to get the exact package you want, as some of the best deals may have already been snapped up. You may also not be able to get the exact dates you want, as the best deals are often for specific dates.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, package holidays do get cheaper nearer the time. However, it is important to know when to book for the best deals. Usually, it's best to book no more than 8-10 weeks before departure, when the bargains flood in. It is also important to be flexible with your travel dates and destination, and to be aware of the risks of booking late.
