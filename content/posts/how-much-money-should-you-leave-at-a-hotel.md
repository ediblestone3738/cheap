# How Much Money Should You Leave at a Hotel?

When it comes to staying in a hotel, there are many things to consider. From choosing the right room to making sure you have all the amenities you need, there is a lot to think about. One of the most important things to consider is how much money you should leave at the hotel.

The American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) recommends leaving a $1-to-$5 tip per day for the housekeeping staff. This is a great way to show your appreciation for the hard work they do to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

## Tips for Tipping at Hotels

When it comes to tipping at hotels, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, it’s important to remember that tipping is not mandatory. However, it is a great way to show your appreciation for the staff.

Second, it’s important to be aware of the tipping culture in the area you are visiting. In some countries, tipping is expected, while in others it is not. It’s important to be aware of the local customs so you can make sure you are tipping appropriately.

Finally, it’s important to remember that the amount you tip should be based on the quality of service you receive. If you are happy with the service you receive, then it’s a good idea to leave a larger tip. On the other hand, if you are not satisfied with the service, then it’s best to leave a smaller tip or none at all.

## How to Leave a Tip at a Hotel

Leaving a tip at a hotel is easy. Most hotels will have an envelope in the room that you can use to leave a tip for the housekeeping staff. Simply fill out the envelope with the amount you would like to leave and place it in a visible location.

If you would like to leave a tip for the front desk staff, you can do so by leaving a cash tip in an envelope at the front desk. Alternatively, you can leave a credit card tip at the front desk.

## Tips for Other Hotel Staff

In addition to housekeeping staff, there are other hotel staff members who may deserve a tip. For example, if you receive exceptional service from the concierge, you may want to leave a tip of $5-$10.

You may also want to consider leaving a tip for the valet or bellhop. A good rule of thumb is to leave a tip of $2-$5 per bag.

## Final Thoughts

When it comes to leaving a tip at a hotel, the American Hotel & Lodging Association recommends leaving a $1-to-$5 tip per day for the housekeeping staff. However, it’s important to be aware of the tipping culture in the area you are visiting and to base the amount you tip on the quality of service you receive.

Finally, it’s important to remember that tipping is not mandatory, but it is a great way to show your appreciation for the hard work of the hotel staff.
