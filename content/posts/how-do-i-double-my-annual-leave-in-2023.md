# How to Double Your Annual Leave in 2023

The start of a new year is always an exciting time, and 2023 is no exception. It’s the perfect time to start planning ahead and making sure you make the most of your annual leave. And if you pick just the right days to take off work in 2023, you could more than double the amount of annual leave you have. Those who plan ahead and take the right days off around public holidays could turn 19 annual leave days into a whopping 47 days off.

## The Basics of Annual Leave

Annual leave is the amount of paid time off that you are entitled to each year. The amount of annual leave you are entitled to depends on your job and the laws in your country. Generally, full-time employees are entitled to at least 20 days of paid leave each year.

## How to Double Your Annual Leave in 2023

If you want to double your annual leave in 2023, you’ll need to plan ahead and take the right days off around public holidays. The key to this is to start planning now and make sure you know which public holidays are coming up in 2023.

The first step is to identify the public holidays that fall on a weekday in 2023. For example, in the United States, there are 10 public holidays that fall on a weekday in 2023, including New Year’s Day (2 Jan 2023), Memorial Day (30 May 2023), Independence Day (4 July 2023), Labor Day (4 Sept 2023), and Thanksgiving (23 Nov 2023).

Once you’ve identified the public holidays that fall on a weekday in 2023, you can start planning your annual leave. The key is to take off the day before and the day after the public holiday. For example, if you take off the 31 Dec 2022 and the 3 Jan 2023, you’ll have effectively taken off four days of annual leave (two days before and two days after the public holiday).

## Tips for Maximizing Your Annual Leave

If you want to maximize your annual leave in 2023, there are a few tips you can follow:

- Plan ahead: Start planning your annual leave as early as possible so you can make sure you get the days off you want.
- Take the right days off: Take off the day before and the day after the public holiday to maximize your annual leave.
- Check your company’s policy: Make sure you know your company’s policy on taking days off around public holidays.
- Be flexible: If you’re flexible with your days off, you may be able to take more days off than you originally planned.

## Conclusion

By planning ahead and taking the right days off around public holidays, you can more than double your annual leave in 2023. With a bit of planning and flexibility, you could turn 19 annual leave days into a whopping 47 days off. So start planning now and make the most of your annual leave in 2023!
