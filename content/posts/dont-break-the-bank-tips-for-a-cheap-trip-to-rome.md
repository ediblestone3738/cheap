Don't Break the Bank: Tips for a Cheap Trip to Rome

Rome is known for its stunning architecture, rich history, delicious food, and warm and welcoming people. Unfortunately, it also has a reputation for being a costly city to visit. But fear not! It is possible to experience all that Rome has to offer without breaking the bank. Here are some tips for a cheap trip to Rome.

Transportation

Getting around Rome can be expensive, but there are some affordable options. One of the best ways to explore the city is on foot. Many of the main attractions are within walking distance from each other, and the narrow streets and charming alleys make for a pleasant stroll.

If you need to use public transportation, buy a single ticket at a cost of €1.50, which is valid for 100 minutes after you first validate it. You can also get a 24-hour ticket for €7.00, a 48-hour ticket for €12.50, or a 72-hour ticket for €18.00. These tickets are valid on buses, trams, and the metro.

Accommodation

There are plenty of affordable accommodation options in Rome. One good tip is to stay outside the city center, as the prices tend to be lower. Some great areas to stay include San Lorenzo, Monti, and Trastevere.

Another option is to stay in a hostel, which can be a fun and budget-friendly way to meet fellow travelers. Some highly-rated hostels in Rome include The Yellow Hostel and Hostel Mosaic.

Food

One of the best things about Rome is its food, but dining out can be expensive. To save money, look for local markets and grocery stores where you can buy ingredients to make your meals. There are also many street food vendors offering delicious and affordable treats. Try some pizza al taglio (pizza by the slice), a suppli (fried rice ball), or a panino (sandwich).

If you do decide to eat at a restaurant, look for places that offer a fixed-price menu or aperitivo, which is an Italian happy hour where you can enjoy a drink and small bites for a lower price.

Attractions

There are countless attractions to see in Rome, but the entrance fees can quickly add up. To save money, look for free or cheaper alternatives. For example, entrance to the Pantheon is free, and you can see many of the city's beautiful fountains and piazzas without having to pay.

If you do want to see some of the paid attractions, look for discounts and deals. Many attractions offer combo tickets, which can save you money if you plan to visit multiple sites. Additionally, if you are a student or under 26, some attractions offer discounts with proper identification.

3\. What is the best way to get from the airport to Rome city center?

The cheapest way to get from the airport to Rome city center is by taking a train or bus. The Leonardo Express train costs €18 and takes about 30 minutes to reach Termini Station. The Terravision bus costs €6 and takes about 45 minutes to reach Termini Station.
