First, it’s important to be flexible with your travel dates. If you’re able to be flexible with your travel dates, you may be able to find cheaper hotel rates. For example, if you’re looking to travel in the summer, you may be able to find cheaper rates if you book your hotel stay during the week instead of on the weekend.

It’s also important to do your research. Take the time to compare prices between different hotels and look for any discounts or promotions that may be available. Many hotels offer discounts for AAA members, military personnel, and senior citizens, so be sure to take advantage of these discounts if you qualify.

Finally, consider using a hotel rewards program. Many hotels offer loyalty programs that allow you to earn points or rewards for each stay. These points can then be used to redeem free nights or discounts on future stays.
