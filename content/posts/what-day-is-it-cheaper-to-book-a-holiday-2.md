# What Day is it Cheaper to Book a Holiday?

Planning a holiday can be an exciting experience, but it can also be expensive. Knowing when to book your holiday can help you save money, so it's important to understand the best time to book. In this blog post, we'll discuss what day is it cheaper to book a holiday and how international holidaymakers can save money.

## When is the Best Time to Book a Holiday?

The best time to book a holiday depends on the type of holiday you're looking for. Generally, it's best to book your holiday at least two months in advance, as this gives you the most options and the best prices. However, if you're looking for a last-minute deal, then booking a week or two before your departure date may be the best option.

When it comes to the day of the week, research has shown that the cheapest day to book a holiday is Wednesday. This is because airlines and travel companies often offer discounts on mid-week bookings. International holidaymakers can also save 5% by booking on a Wednesday, instead of Saturday, the priciest day to book.

## Tips for Saving Money on Your Holiday Booking

There are a few other tips you can use to save money when booking a holiday. Firstly, try to be flexible with your dates. Airlines and travel companies often offer discounts for bookings made outside of peak times, such as school holidays.

You should also consider booking a package holiday. Package holidays are often cheaper than booking flights and accommodation separately, as the travel company can offer discounts for booking multiple services at once.

Finally, it's important to compare prices. Don't just book the first holiday you find - shop around and compare prices to make sure you're getting the best deal.

## Conclusion

Booking a holiday can be expensive, but there are ways to save money. The best day to book a holiday is Wednesday, as airlines and travel companies often offer discounts on mid-week bookings. International holidaymakers can also save 5% by booking on a Wednesday, instead of Saturday, the priciest day to book.

In addition to booking on the right day, you should also be flexible with your dates, consider booking a package holiday, and compare prices to make sure you're getting the best deal. With these tips, you can save money on your next holiday booking.

Happy travels!
