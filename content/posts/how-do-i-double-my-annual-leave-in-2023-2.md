# How to Double Your Annual Leave in 2023

Do you want to double your annual leave in 2023? With the right planning, you can turn 19 days of annual leave into a whopping 47 days off. That’s almost five weeks of vacation! Here’s how to do it.

## Choose the Right Days to Take Off

The key to doubling your annual leave in 2023 is to choose the right days to take off. If you plan ahead and pick the right days around public holidays, you can get more than double the amount of annual leave you have.

For example, if you take off the 2nd of January 2023, you’ll get an extra three days off. That’s because the 2nd of January is a public holiday in many countries, so you’ll get an extra day off on either side of the holiday.

## Plan Your Vacation Around Public Holidays

The best way to double your annual leave in 2023 is to plan your vacation around public holidays. For example, if you take off the 1st of January 2023, you’ll get an extra four days off. That’s because the 1st of January is a public holiday in many countries, so you’ll get an extra day off on either side of the holiday, plus the public holiday itself.

You can also get extra days off by taking off the days before and after other public holidays. For example, if you take off the 31st of December 2022 and the 2nd of January 2023, you’ll get an extra five days off. That’s because the 31st of December is a public holiday in many countries, so you’ll get an extra day off on either side of the holiday, plus the public holiday itself.

## Take Advantage of Long Weekends

Another way to double your annual leave in 2023 is to take advantage of long weekends. For example, if you take off the 30th of December 2022 and the 2nd of January 2023, you’ll get an extra four days off. That’s because the 30th of December is a public holiday in many countries, so you’ll get an extra day off on either side of the holiday, plus the public holiday itself.

You can also get extra days off by taking off the days before and after other long weekends. For example, if you take off the 28th of December 2022 and the 3rd of January 2023, you’ll get an extra five days off. That’s because the 28th of December is a public holiday in many countries, so you’ll get an extra day off on either side of the holiday, plus the public holiday itself.

## Plan Ahead for Maximum Benefit

The key to doubling your annual leave in 2023 is to plan ahead. Start by looking at the public holidays in your country and planning your vacation around them. Then, look for long weekends and plan your vacation around those as well.

By planning ahead and taking the right days off around public holidays and long weekends, you can turn 19 days of annual leave into a whopping 47 days off. That’s almost five weeks of vacation!

## Conclusion

If you want to double your annual leave in 2023, the key is to plan ahead and take the right days off around public holidays and long weekends. With the right planning, you can turn 19 days of annual leave into a whopping 47 days off. That’s almost five weeks of vacation! So start planning now and get ready to enjoy your extra days off in 2023.
