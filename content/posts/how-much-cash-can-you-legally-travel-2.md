# How Much Cash Can You Legally Travel With?

Traveling with cash can be a great way to ensure you have the funds you need while on the go. But it’s important to know the rules and regulations surrounding how much cash you can legally travel with.

## International Travelers Entering the United States

International travelers entering the United States must declare if they are carrying currency or monetary instruments in a combined amount over $10,000 on their Customs Declaration Form (CBP Form 6059B) and then file a FinCEN Form 105. This includes cash, travelers checks, money orders, and any other negotiable instruments.

## Declaring Currency When Entering the United States

When entering the United States, you must declare any currency or monetary instruments that exceed $10,000. This includes any foreign currency, coins, or traveler’s checks. You must fill out the FinCEN Form 105 and present it to a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer. The CBP officer will then review the form and determine if any additional information is needed.

## Penalties for Not Declaring Currency

If you fail to declare currency or monetary instruments in excess of $10,000, you may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. This includes fines of up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment for up to five years. Additionally, the currency or monetary instruments may be seized by the CBP.

## Exceptions to the $10,000 Rule

There are some exceptions to the $10,000 rule. For example, if you are traveling with a family member, each person can declare up to $10,000 without having to file a FinCEN Form 105. Additionally, if you are traveling with a group of people, each person can declare up to $10,000 without having to file a FinCEN Form 105.

## Traveling with Cash

When traveling with cash, it’s important to be aware of the rules and regulations surrounding how much cash you can legally travel with. International travelers entering the United States must declare if they are carrying currency or monetary instruments in a combined amount over $10,000 on their Customs Declaration Form (CBP Form 6059B) and then file a FinCEN Form 105. Failure to declare currency or monetary instruments in excess of $10,000 may result in civil and criminal penalties.

## Conclusion
