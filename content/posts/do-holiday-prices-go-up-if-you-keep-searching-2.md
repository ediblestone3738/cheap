# Do Holiday Prices Go Up If You Keep Searching?

As a travel expert, I often get asked whether holiday prices go up if you keep searching. It's a common belief that the more you look at flights, the higher the costs get. But is this really true?

Recent data suggests that this isn't the case. In fact, the opposite may be true. By searching for flights and holidays regularly, you may actually be able to get a better deal.

## What is Browsing History?

Browsing history is a record of the websites and pages you have visited on the internet. It is stored in your web browser and can be used to track your online activity.

When you search for flights or holidays online, the websites you visit will be stored in your browsing history. This means that the websites you visit will be able to track your activity and may be able to use this information to tailor the prices they offer you.

## Does Browsing History Affect Prices?

The short answer is no. There is no evidence to suggest that browsing history affects the prices you are offered for flights or holidays.

However, there are some factors that can affect the prices you are offered. For example, the time of year, the destination, and the type of ticket you are looking for can all affect the prices you are offered.

## Tips for Finding the Best Deals

If you want to get the best deals on flights and holidays, there are a few things you can do.

Firstly, it's important to shop around. Don't just stick to one website or airline. Compare prices across different websites and airlines to find the best deal.

Secondly, be flexible with your dates. If you are able to be flexible with your travel dates, you may be able to find cheaper flights and holidays.

Finally, sign up for email alerts. Many websites and airlines offer email alerts when prices drop. This can be a great way to stay up to date with the latest deals.

## Conclusion

So, does your browsing history bump up the price? The answer is no. There is no evidence to suggest that browsing history affects the prices you are offered for flights or holidays.

However, there are some factors that can affect the prices you are offered. Shopping around, being flexible with your dates, and signing up for email alerts can all help you to find the best deals.

Happy travels!
