The Greek Islands are widely known for their stunning beaches, crystal-clear waters, historic landmarks and ancient ruins. With over 6,000 islands and islets scattered across the Aegean and Ionian Seas, there’s no shortage of places to explore. While many of these destinations are well-known and frequented by tourists from around the world, there are also plenty of hidden gems that offer all the charm without the hefty price tag. In this article, we’ll take a look at how to plan [cheap holidays](/holidaydestinations/cheap-holiday-to-iceland/ "Cheap holiday to Iceland") to the Greek Islands, along with the top 10 tourist attractions to see on your trip.

Planning Cheap Holidays to the Greek Islands

1\. When to Go

The Greek Islands are busiest during the summer months, especially in July and August when the weather is the warmest. However, this is also the most expensive time to visit. If you’re looking to save money, consider visiting during the shoulder season (May-June or September-October) when hotels and flights are often cheaper and the crowds are smaller.

2\. Choose your Destination Wisely

While destinations like Santorini and Mykonos are popular, they’re also notoriously expensive. If you’re looking for a cheaper alternative, consider visiting islands like Naxos, Paros, or Ios. These islands offer the same stunning beaches, picturesque towns, and fresh Mediterranean cuisine without the sky-high prices.

3\. Explore on Foot or by Bicycle

Many of the Greek islands are small enough to explore on foot or by bike, which is a cheap and eco-friendly mode of transportation. This is also a great way to see the local sights and scenery up close as you wander through charming villages and uncover hidden gems along the way.

4\. Try Local Cuisine

Greek cuisine is delicious and often features fresh ingredients like seafood, olives, feta cheese, and tzatziki. While there are plenty of upscale restaurants to choose from, you can also save money by trying local tavernas and cafes where the food is just as good but much more affordable.

5\. Book in Advance

If you’re planning on visiting during the high season, booking your accommodation and flights well in advance can help you secure better deals. Additionally, consider booking through online travel agencies or using coupon codes to save even more money on your trip.

This all depends on your personal preferences and what you’re looking for in a holiday. Popular islands include Santorini, Mykonos, and Crete, but there are plenty of lesser-known islands that offer just as much charm and beauty. Some of our favorites include Naxos, Paros, and Koufonisia.
