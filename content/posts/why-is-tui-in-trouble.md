# Why is TUI in Trouble?

Holiday group TUI has recently revealed a £63 million hit from the recent travel chaos that crippled airports and led to flight cancellations and lengthy delays. The firm said its customers were affected by about 200 cancelled flights in May and June, mainly relating to departures from Manchester Airport amid staff shortages.

## Impact of Flight Cancellations

The flight cancellations have had a significant impact on TUI’s bottom line. The company has had to refund customers for their cancelled flights, as well as compensate them for any inconvenience caused. This has resulted in a £63 million hit to the company’s profits.

## Increased Competition

TUI is also facing increased competition from other holiday companies. With the rise of budget airlines, many customers are now opting for cheaper flights and holiday packages. This has put pressure on TUI’s profits, as they are unable to compete with the lower prices offered by other companies.

## Staff Shortages

The staff shortages at Manchester Airport have also had an impact on TUI’s operations. The company has had to cancel flights due to the lack of staff available to operate them. This has caused disruption to customers, as well as a financial hit to the company.

## Brexit Uncertainty

The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has also had an impact on TUI’s operations. The company has had to adjust its operations to account for the potential changes that could occur when the UK leaves the EU. This has caused disruption to customers, as well as a financial hit to the company.

## Conclusion

TUI is facing a number of challenges that have had a significant impact on its bottom line. The flight cancellations, increased competition, staff shortages and Brexit uncertainty have all had an impact on the company’s operations and profits. TUI is now facing a difficult period as it looks to recover from the recent travel chaos and return to profitability.
