# What Days to Book Off in 2023?

As the year 2023 approaches, it's important to plan ahead and consider what days you should book off for the year. Whether you're looking to take a holiday, spend time with family, or just have a break from work, having the right days off can make all the difference. To help you plan your year, here's a list of the days you should book off in 2023.

## New Year's Day (Substitute)

The first day of the year is usually New Year's Day, but in 2023 it falls on a Sunday. This means that the substitute day for New Year's Day will be Monday, January 2.

## Good Friday

Good Friday is the Friday before Easter Sunday, and in 2023 it falls on Friday, April 7. This is a public holiday in many countries, so it's a great day to book off for a long weekend.

## Easter Monday

Easter Monday is the Monday after Easter Sunday, and in 2023 it falls on Monday, April 10. This is another public holiday in many countries, so it's a great day to book off for a long weekend.

## Early May Bank Holiday

The Early May Bank Holiday is the first Monday in May, and in 2023 it falls on Monday, May 1. This is a public holiday in many countries, so it's a great day to book off for a long weekend.

## Spring Bank Holiday

The Spring Bank Holiday is the last Monday in May, and in 2023 it falls on Monday, May 29. This is a public holiday in many countries, so it's a great day to book off for a long weekend.

## Summer Bank Holiday

The Summer Bank Holiday is the last Monday in August, and in 2023 it falls on Monday, August 28. This is a public holiday in many countries, so it's a great day to book off for a long weekend.

## Boxing Day

Boxing Day is the day after Christmas Day, and in 2023 it falls on Tuesday, December 26. This is a public holiday in many countries, so it's a great day to book off for a long weekend.

## 4 Sept 2022

The 4th of September 2022 is not a public holiday, but it is a day that many people choose to book off. This is because it is the day before the start of the school year in many countries, so it's a great day to spend some extra time with family before the school year begins.

No matter what days you choose to book off in 2023, it's important to plan ahead and make sure you have the right days off. With the right days off, you can make the most of your year and make sure you get the rest and relaxation you need.

Happy planning!
