# How to Get Maximum Holiday in 2023

With the new year upon us, it’s time to start planning your holiday for 2023. This year, Good Friday (April 7) and Easter Monday (April 10) will both be observed as bank holidays, giving you the opportunity to take advantage of the long weekend and get some extra days off.

If you’re looking to make the most of the bank holidays, you can actually be off for 10 days, from Sunday, April 7 to Wednesday, April 14 - while just using four days of annual leave (April 11, 12, 13 and 14).

## Step 1: Check Your Leave Entitlement

The first step to getting maximum holiday in 2023 is to check your leave entitlement. Different employers have different policies, so it’s important to check with your employer to see how much leave you’re entitled to.

## Step 2: Plan Your Leave Dates

Once you’ve checked your leave entitlement, it’s time to plan your leave dates. As mentioned above, Good Friday (April 7) and Easter Monday (April 10) will both be observed as bank holidays, so you can use four days of annual leave (April 11, 12, 13 and 14) to get 10 days off.

## Step 3: Book Your Travel

Once you’ve planned your leave dates, it’s time to book your travel. If you’re planning a staycation, make sure to book your accommodation and any activities you’d like to do in advance. If you’re planning a trip abroad, make sure to book your flights and accommodation as soon as possible to get the best deals.

## Step 4: Plan Your Activities

No matter where you’re going, it’s important to plan your activities in advance. This will help you make the most of your time off and ensure you don’t miss out on any of the fun.

## Step 5: Make Sure You’re Prepared

Before you go on holiday, make sure you’re prepared. This includes packing your suitcase, sorting out any travel documents you need, and making sure you have enough money for your trip.

## Step 6: Enjoy Your Holiday!

Once you’ve done all the preparation, it’s time to enjoy your holiday! Make sure to take some time to relax and have fun, and don’t forget to take lots of photos to remember your trip.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can make the most of the bank holidays in 2023 and get 10 days off while only using four days of annual leave. So start planning your holiday now and make the most of the long weekend!
