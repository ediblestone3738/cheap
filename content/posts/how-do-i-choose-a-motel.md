# How do I choose a motel? 9 Tips for Picking a Good Hotel Online

Choosing a motel can be a daunting task, especially if you are looking for a good hotel online. With so many options available, it can be difficult to know which one is right for you. To help you make the best decision, here are nine tips for picking a good hotel online.

## 1\. Know what is most important to you

The first step in choosing a motel is to determine what is most important to you. Are you looking for a hotel with a great view? Or maybe you want one that is close to attractions and restaurants. Knowing what is important to you will help you narrow down your choices and make the process easier.

## 2\. Know the Holy Grail of amenities

When it comes to amenities, the “Holy Grail” is a hotel that offers free Wi-Fi, a swimming pool, a fitness center, and a restaurant. These amenities are usually found in higher-end hotels, but they can also be found in some budget-friendly motels. Knowing what amenities you want will help you find the right hotel for your needs.

## 3\. Check the hotel's website

Before you book a hotel, it’s important to check the hotel’s website. This will give you an idea of what the hotel offers and what amenities are available. You can also get a better sense of the hotel’s atmosphere and see if it’s the right fit for you.

## 4\. Look at a map to determine a hotel's exact location

When you’re looking for a motel, it’s important to look at a map to determine the exact location. This will help you determine how close the hotel is to attractions, restaurants, and other points of interest. It will also help you determine if the hotel is in a safe area.

## 5\. Find out when both the rooms and public spaces were last updated

When you’re looking for a motel, it’s important to find out when the rooms and public spaces were last updated. This will give you an idea of how modern and up-to-date the hotel is. It’s also a good idea to check the hotel’s website to see if there are any recent renovations or updates.

## 6\. Focus on guest reviews published within the last year

When you’re looking for a motel, it’s important to focus on guest reviews published within the last year. This will give you an idea of what other people have experienced at the hotel. It’s also a good idea to read reviews from multiple sources, such as TripAdvisor, Expedia, and Google.

## 7\. Check the hotel's cancellation policy

Before you book a hotel, it’s important to check the hotel’s cancellation policy. This will help you determine if you can cancel your reservation without penalty if your plans change. It’s also a good idea to check the hotel’s website to see if there are any special offers or discounts available.

## 8\. Consider the hotel's safety features

When you’re looking for a motel, it’s important to consider the hotel’s safety features. This includes things like security cameras, secure locks, and fire alarms. It’s also a good idea to check the hotel’s website to see if there are any safety features mentioned.

## 9\. Compare prices

The last step in choosing a motel is to compare prices. This will help you find the best deal and ensure that you get the most value for your money. It’s also a good idea to check the hotel’s website to see if there are any special offers or discounts available.

Choosing a motel can be a daunting task, but with these nine tips for picking a good hotel online, you can make the process easier. By knowing what is important to you, focusing on guest reviews, and comparing prices, you can find the perfect motel for your needs.
