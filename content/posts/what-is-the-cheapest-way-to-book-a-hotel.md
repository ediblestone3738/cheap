## 4\. Check Prices Directly With Hotels

Sometimes the best deals can be found by checking directly with the hotel. Many hotels offer discounts and promotions that aren’t available through booking engines. It’s worth checking directly with the hotel to see if they have any special offers.

## 5\. Book In Advance With Free Cancellation

Booking in advance can help you get the best deals. Many hotels offer free cancellation if you book in advance. This means you can book the hotel and if you find a better deal later, you can cancel the booking and get a full refund.

Booking in advance with a non-refundable rate can also help you get the best deals. Non-refundable rates are usually cheaper than regular rates, so you can save money by booking in advance. Just make sure you’re sure you’ll be able to make the trip before you book.

Price comparison sites can help you find the best deals. These sites compare prices from different booking engines and hotels, so you can easily find the best deal.

If you’re flexible with your travel dates, you can often find great last minute deals. Many hotels offer discounts for last minute bookings, so you can save money if you’re willing to be flexible.

## 9\. Look For Package Deals

Many hotels offer package deals that include flights, car rentals, and other services. These packages can be cheaper than booking everything separately, so it’s worth looking for package deals when booking your hotel.

## 10\. Look For Discounts For Longer Stays

Many hotels offer discounts for longer stays. If you’re planning to stay for more than a few days, it’s worth looking for discounts for longer stays.

## 11\. Look For Special Promotions

Many hotels offer special promotions throughout the year. Keep an eye out for these promotions and take advantage of them when you can.

## 12\. Join Hotel Loyalty Programs

Many hotels offer loyalty programs that give you access to exclusive discounts and deals. Joining these programs can help you save money on your next hotel stay.

## 13\. Look For Discounts For Groups

If you’re traveling with a group, you can often get discounts for booking multiple rooms. It’s worth looking for discounts for groups when booking your hotel.

Many hotels offer discounts for seniors. If you’re a senior, it’s worth looking for discounts when booking your hotel.
