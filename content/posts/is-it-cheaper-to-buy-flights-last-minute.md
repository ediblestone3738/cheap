# Is it Cheaper to Buy Flights Last Minute?

We’ve all heard the stories of people scoring a last minute flight deal so cheap it induces shock. But is it really cheaper to buy flights last minute? The answer is no. It’s not cheaper to buy flights last minute.

## Why It’s Not Cheaper to Buy Flights Last Minute

When airlines are looking to fill up their flights, they will sometimes offer discounted fares to entice travelers to book. But these discounted fares are usually only available for a limited time and usually require travelers to book several weeks in advance. Last minute flights are rarely discounted.

The reason why airlines don’t offer discounted fares for last minute flights is because they want to maximize their profits. Airlines know that last minute travelers are often desperate to get to their destination and are willing to pay more for the convenience of booking last minute. So, airlines will often charge more for last minute flights than they would for flights booked several weeks in advance.

## How to Find Last Minute Flight Deals

Although it’s not usually cheaper to buy flights last minute, there are still ways to find last minute flight deals. The key is to be flexible with your travel dates and destinations.

The best way to find last minute flight deals is to use a flight search engine. These search engines allow you to search for flights by destination, date, and price. You can also use filters to narrow down your search results. For example, you can filter your search results by airline, departure time, and number of stops.

Once you’ve found a flight that meets your criteria, you can compare the price with other flights to make sure you’re getting the best deal. You can also sign up for flight alerts so you’ll be notified when the price of a flight drops.

## Tips for Last Minute Travelers

If you’re planning to travel last minute, there are a few tips you should keep in mind.

First, make sure you’re flexible with your travel dates and destinations. Last minute flights are often more expensive, so you’ll want to look for flights that are slightly cheaper than the ones you’re looking at.

Second, be prepared to pay more for last minute flights. Airlines know that last minute travelers are often desperate to get to their destination and are willing to pay more for the convenience of booking last minute.

Finally, use a flight search engine to compare prices and sign up for flight alerts. This will help you find the best deals on last minute flights.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, it’s not usually cheaper to buy flights last minute. Airlines know that last minute travelers are often desperate to get to their destination and are willing to pay more for the convenience of booking last minute. However, there are still ways to find last minute flight deals. By being flexible with your travel dates and destinations, using a flight search engine to compare prices, and signing up for flight alerts, you can find the best deals on last minute flights.
