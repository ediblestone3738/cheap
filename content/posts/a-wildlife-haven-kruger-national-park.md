A Wildlife Haven: Kruger National Park

Kruger National Park is the largest wildlife sanctuary in South Africa and one of the largest in the world. Located in the northeastern part of the country, this park covers an area of approximately 20,000 square kilometers and is home to a wide range of wildlife species. The park is also a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from all over the world who come to experience the thrill of seeing Africa's big five animals in their natural habitat.

Heading 1: Location and History

Kruger National Park is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, near the border with Mozambique.
