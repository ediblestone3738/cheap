# How Many Weeks in Advance Should You Book a Holiday?

When it comes to booking a holiday, it can be hard to know when the best time to book is. You want to get the best deal, but you don’t want to miss out on choice. So when is the best time to book a holiday?

## Booking Flights

When it comes to booking flights, the general rule of thumb is to book more than 3 weeks ahead for the best deals. Airlines often release their cheapest fares around 3-4 weeks before the departure date, so this is the best time to book if you want to get the best deal.

However, it is worth noting that if you wait until the last minute, you may be able to get some great deals. Airlines often need to fill seats and will offer discounted fares in the days leading up to the departure date. So if you are flexible and don’t mind where you go, you may be able to get some great last minute deals.

## Booking Hotels

When it comes to booking hotels, the best time to book is around 3-4 weeks ahead. This is because hotels often release their best deals around this time. If you wait until the last minute, you may be able to get some great deals, but you risk missing out on choice. Hotels can fill up quickly, so if you wait until the last minute you may find that all the best rooms have already been taken.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the best time to book a holiday is around 3-4 weeks ahead. This is the best time to book flights for the best deals, and the best time to book hotels for the best deals and choice. However, if you are flexible and don’t mind where you go, you may be able to get some great last minute deals.

So if you are planning a holiday, make sure to book at least 3 weeks ahead for the best deals and choice.
