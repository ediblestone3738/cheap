Athens, the capital city of Greece, is a city that is drenched in history, culture, traditions, and mouth-watering cuisine.  Also known as the birthplace of Western civilization, Athens will take you on an unforgettable journey back in time. In just two days, you can experience Athens's cultural feast like never before.

Day 1

Start your day at the Acropolis, an ancient citadel perched atop a hill. The Acropolis offers stunning views of Athens and is home to three main temples - the Parthenon, Erectheion, and the Temple of Athena Nike. The Parthenon, with its elegantly proportioned columns and exquisite friezes, is the most iconic structure in Athens.

Next, visit the Ancient Agora of Athens, located northwest of the Acropolis. The Agora was once the center of political and commercial life in ancient Athens. It has been a bustling marketplace for over 2,500 years and is home to some of the best-preserved ruins of ancient Greek life. Here, you can view various ancient structures such as the Stoa of Attalos, the Tholos, and the Temple of Hephaestus.

In the evening, head towards Plaka - the oldest neighborhood in Athens. This picturesque neighborhood is paved with cobblestone streets and is lined with traditional Greek tavernas and charming shops selling handicrafts and souvenirs.

Day 2

Begin your day at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, which is one of the most important museums in the world. Here, you can see some of the most astonishing works of ancient Greece, including the Mask of Agamemnon, the Mycenaean gold, and the statue of Zeus.

Next, head towards the Temple of Olympian Zeus, one of the largest temples in ancient Greece. The temple was constructed over several centuries and took over 700 years to complete. Today, only a few columns and architraves remain.

In the afternoon, explore the city's vibrant markets. Start with Varvakios Agora, Athens' central food market. It is a large market that sells various types of Greek produce, meats, fish, and spices. As you walk around the market, be sure to try some traditional Greek delicacies such as Spanakopita (spinach pie) and Souvlaki (meat skewers).

After exploring the food market, head towards Monastiraki Flea Market. It is a bustling market that sells everything from antiques to second-hand clothes, traditional Greek ceramics, and jewelry.

In the evening, watch a performance at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, a magnificent stone theater that has been used for concerts, operas, and plays for over two millennia.
