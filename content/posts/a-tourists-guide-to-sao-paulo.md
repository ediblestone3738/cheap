A Tourist's Guide to São Paulo

São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, is a bustling metropolis that offers a vibrant mix of culture, history, and modernity. With its skyscrapers, museums, parks, and restaurants, it's easy to see why São Paulo attracts millions of tourists every year. Here's a comprehensive guide for anyone planning to visit the city.

Getting There

São Paulo is served by two airports, Guarulhos and Congonhas. Guarulhos is the main international hub, and Congonhas serves mostly domestic flights.

São Paulo has accommodations to suit any budget. From luxury hotels such as the Hotel Unique, Grand Hyatt, and Tivoli Mofarrej, to mid-range options like the Mercure and Novotel, to hostels and budget hotels. In general, hotels in the city center are more expensive, and those in the suburbs are more affordable.

Transportation

Like most big cities, São Paulo is known for its traffic jams. If you're staying in the city center, you might find it easier to walk or use public transportation. The city has an extensive metro and bus system that covers most tourist attractions. You can buy a rechargeable card (Bilhete Único) that works on both metro and bus, or you can buy single-use tickets. Taxis and Ubers are also widely available.
