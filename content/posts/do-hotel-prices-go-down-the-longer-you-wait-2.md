# Do Hotel Prices Go Down the Longer You Wait?

As a travel expert, I often get asked whether hotel prices go down the longer you wait. The answer is actually yes! According to Shank, a hotel industry expert, you can be rewarded with a better deal if you wait to make your plans. On average, same-day rates on HotelTonight are 10 percent less than if you book the day before.

## How to Get the Best Hotel Deals

If you’re looking to get the best hotel deals, here are some tips to keep in mind:

### 1\. Book Last Minute

If you’re looking for a great deal, booking last minute can be a great way to save money. Hotels often have rooms that need to be filled, so they’ll offer discounts to attract customers. This is especially true if you’re booking on the same day as your stay.

### 2\. Look for Special Deals

Many hotels offer special deals throughout the year. These deals can range from discounts for certain days of the week to discounts for certain types of travelers. Be sure to keep an eye out for these special deals, as they can save you a lot of money.

### 3\. Use a Hotel Booking Site

Using a hotel booking site can be a great way to find the best deals. Sites like Hotels.com and Expedia often have discounts and special offers that you won’t find anywhere else. Be sure to compare prices on different sites to make sure you’re getting the best deal.

### 4\. Sign Up for Loyalty Programs

Many hotels offer loyalty programs that reward you for staying with them. These programs often offer discounts and other perks that can save you money. Be sure to sign up for any loyalty programs that you’re eligible for.

## Conclusion

So, do hotel prices go down the longer you wait? The answer is yes! By booking last minute, looking for special deals, using a hotel booking site, and signing up for loyalty programs, you can get the best hotel deals and save money.

Happy travels!
