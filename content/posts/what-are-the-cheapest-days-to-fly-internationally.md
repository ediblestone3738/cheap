# What Are the Cheapest Days to Fly Internationally?

When it comes to planning a trip abroad, one of the most important factors to consider is the cost of airfare. Fortunately, there are certain days of the week that are cheaper than others when it comes to international flights. According to Hopper economist Hayley Berg, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the most inexpensive days to travel internationally, while Wednesday tends to be the cheapest for domestic travel.

## Why Are Tuesdays and Wednesdays Cheaper?

Berg explains that the days that other people are less likely to want to travel are always going to be the cheapest days. This means that Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the least popular days for people to fly, and therefore, airlines tend to offer discounted fares on these days. This is especially true for international flights, as people are more likely to travel on the weekends when they have more time off from work.

## How to Find the Cheapest Fares

When it comes to finding the cheapest fares, Berg recommends using an online flight search engine. This will allow you to compare prices from different airlines and find the best deal. It’s also important to keep an eye out for any special offers or discounts that may be available. Additionally, Berg suggests signing up for email alerts from airlines, as they often send out notifications about special deals or discounts.

## Tips for Saving Money on Flights

In addition to flying on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, there are a few other tips that can help you save money on flights. For example, Berg recommends booking your flight as far in advance as possible. This will give you more time to compare prices and find the best deal. Additionally, she suggests being flexible with your travel dates, as this can often lead to cheaper fares. Finally, Berg recommends using a credit card that offers rewards points, as this can help you save money on future flights.

## Conclusion

When it comes to finding the cheapest days to fly internationally, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually the best bet. However, there are a few other tips that can help you save money on flights, such as booking in advance, being flexible with your travel dates, and using a credit card with rewards points. By following these tips, you can ensure that you get the best deal on your next international flight.
