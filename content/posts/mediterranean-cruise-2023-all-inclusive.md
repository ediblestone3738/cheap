You can choose between interior staterooms, ocean view staterooms, balconies, and suites. The best part is that with an all-inclusive package, you don't have to worry about cleaning or maintenance.

When you're on a Mediterranean cruise, you get to indulge in an array of cuisines from around the world. With your all-inclusive package, all your meals and beverages are sorted out. It's time to tantalize your taste buds with classic Mediterranean dishes that incorporate fresh seafood, delicious pasta, and veggies, among other dishes.

Most cruise lines have a selection of specialty restaurants where you can enjoy different cuisines. You can also enjoy room service or buffet-style service for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. When it comes to beverages, an all-inclusive package includes all types of drinks from cocktails, wine, beer, and soft drinks.

Entertainment and Activities

The fun never ends when you're on a Mediterranean cruise. There is so much to see, do, and explore to keep you engaged throughout the trip. Regardless of your age or interests, you can enjoy a range of activities on board and onshore. The all-inclusive package covers all these activities, so you don't have to spend extra money.

There's an array of entertainment options to pick from, including live music, Broadway shows, casinos, comedy clubs, discos, and much more. The cruise ships also have a wide range of outdoor activities like rock climbing, mini-golf, basketball courts, and swimming pools.

1\. How do I know what to pack?

Packing for a Mediterranean cruise can be overwhelming, but our recommendation is to pack for different weather scenarios since the climate will vary depending on the ports of call. Don't forget to pack comfortable clothing, swimsuits, and sunscreen.

2\. Can I use my phone on board?

Yes, most cruise ships have Wi-Fi packages and cell service that you can access. However, these services come at an additional cost.

3\. Do I need travel insurance?

We highly recommend getting travel insurance to protect you from any unforeseen circumstances that may arise. It's essential to review the insurance policy to understand what's covered.

4\. Can I bring my own alcohol?

Most cruise ships don't allow passengers to bring their own alcohol on board, but you can purchase beverage packages that are part of your all-inclusive package.

5\. What type of currency should I carry?

The currency used in the Mediterranean will vary depending on the ports of call. We recommend exchanging your currency at ports or using credit cards that are widely accepted.

Conclusion

A Mediterranean cruise is an excellent way to experience the rich culture and history of the region while enjoying all-inclusive amenities. With an all-inclusive package, you get to sit back, relax, and enjoy the best of what the Mediterranean has to offer.
