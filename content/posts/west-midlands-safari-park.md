The park's evolution mirrors significant shifts in wildlife conservation and animal welfare practices over the years. Initially, it focused on traditional zoo exhibits. However, in response to growing awareness about animal rights and the need for conservation efforts, it has transformed itself into a center for education and preservation. This commitment to animal welfare is evident in the expansive enclosures designed to mimic natural habitats, allowing the animals to roam freely and interact as they would in the wild.
