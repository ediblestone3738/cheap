# What is the 72 Hour Rule in Hotels?

When it comes to booking a hotel, it is important to be aware of the 72 hour rule. This rule is a standard policy that many hotels have in place in order to protect themselves from any last minute cancellations. In this article, we will discuss what the 72 hour rule is and how it can affect your hotel reservation.

## What is the 72 Hour Rule?

The 72 hour rule is a policy that many hotels have in place in order to protect themselves from any last minute cancellations. According to this rule, reservations must be cancelled seventy two (72) hours prior to your arrival date in order to avoid a one (1) night full room cancellation fee. If reservations are cancelled less than 72 hours before the arrival date, you may be charged the full room charge plus taxes.

## Why is the 72 Hour Rule in Place?

The 72 hour rule is in place to protect hotels from any last minute cancellations. Hotels are often left with empty rooms if reservations are cancelled at the last minute, which can be costly for them. The 72 hour rule ensures that hotels are not left with empty rooms due to last minute cancellations.

## What Happens if I Cancel my Reservation After the 72 Hour Deadline?

If you cancel your reservation after the 72 hour deadline, you may be charged the full room charge plus taxes. This fee is usually non-refundable and is intended to cover the cost of the hotel for the night that you were supposed to stay.

## What if I Need to Change my Reservation?

If you need to change your reservation, it is important to contact the hotel as soon as possible. Many hotels are willing to work with you to make changes to your reservation, but it is important to keep in mind that the 72 hour rule still applies. If you need to make changes to your reservation within the 72 hour window, you may be charged a fee.

## How Can I Avoid the 72 Hour Rule?

The best way to avoid the 72 hour rule is to plan ahead and book your hotel reservation as far in advance as possible. This will give you plenty of time to make any changes or cancellations without incurring any fees. It is also important to read the cancellation policy of the hotel before making your reservation. This will ensure that you are aware of any fees that may be associated with cancelling or changing your reservation.

## Conclusion

The 72 hour rule is a policy that many hotels have in place in order to protect themselves from any last minute cancellations. It is important to be aware of this rule when booking a hotel, as it can affect your reservation. To avoid any fees associated with the 72 hour rule, it is best to plan ahead and book your hotel reservation as far in advance as possible. It is also important to read the cancellation policy of the hotel before making your reservation.
