# How Much Cash Can You Legally Travel With?

Traveling with cash can be a great way to ensure that you have access to the funds you need while on the go. But it’s important to know the rules and regulations around how much cash you can legally travel with.

## What is the Legal Limit?

International travelers entering the United States must declare if they are carrying currency or monetary instruments in a combined amount over $10,000 on their Customs Declaration Form (CBP Form 6059B) and then file a FinCEN Form 105.

This applies to both US citizens and non-US citizens, and the declaration must be made regardless of the currency type. So, if you’re carrying cash in multiple currencies, you must declare the total amount in US dollars.

## What Happens if You Don’t Declare?

If you fail to declare the cash you’re carrying, you could face serious consequences. You could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and jail time.

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may also seize your cash if it is found to be in violation of the law. In some cases, the CBP may allow you to keep the cash if you can prove that it was obtained legally.

## What if You Have More Than $10,000?

If you’re carrying more than $10,000 in cash, you must declare it on the CBP Form 6059B and file a FinCEN Form 105. This form is used to report the transportation of currency or monetary instruments into or out of the United States.

The FinCEN Form 105 must be filed within 15 days of the date of entry or departure. It’s important to note that this form must be filed even if you are carrying less than $10,000.

## Are There Any Exceptions?

There are some exceptions to the rule. For example, travelers who are under the age of 18 and are traveling with their parents or guardians are not required to declare the cash they are carrying.

Additionally, travelers who are traveling with a pet are not required to declare the cash they are carrying if the pet is accompanying them.

## Conclusion

It’s important to be aware of the rules and regulations around how much cash you can legally travel with. International travelers entering the United States must declare if they are carrying currency or monetary instruments in a combined amount over $10,000 on their Customs Declaration Form (CBP Form 6059B) and then file a FinCEN Form 105.

Failure to declare the cash you’re carrying could result in serious consequences, including fines and jail time. So, it’s important to be aware of the rules and regulations and to make sure you’re following them.
