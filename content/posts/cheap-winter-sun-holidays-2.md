\- Use a high factor sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Apply it liberally to all exposed skin, including the face, neck, chest and back.

\- Seek shade during the strongest hours of the sun (usually between 11am and 3pm).
\- Cover up with clothing, including a hat, long-sleeved shirt and long pants.
\- Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.
\- Avoid outdoor activities if you have a history of skin cancer or other conditions that make your skin more sensitive to sunlight.</p><br /><h2>Winter sun holidays: what to pack for your trip</h2><br /><p>

With winter sun holidays becoming increasingly popular, it’s important to know what to pack for your trip. Although the days may be shorter, there’s still plenty of opportunity to enjoy the warm weather and beautiful scenery.

Here are some essential items to pack for your winter sun holiday:

- **Sunscreen**: Even if the temperature isn’t that high, the sun’s rays can be very strong. Be sure to pack a high factor sunscreen and apply it regularly throughout the day.

- **Hat and sunglasses**: A hat and sunglasses will protect you from the sun and help you to avoid squinting in bright conditions.

- **Lightweight clothing**: Pack light clothing that is loose fitting and comfortable. Cotton is a good choice as it is breathable and will keep you cool in warm weather.

- **Comfortable shoes**: You’ll probably do a lot of walking on your holiday, so make sure you pack a comfortable pair of shoes. Sandals or trainers are ideal.

- **Beach accessories**: If you’re planning on spending time at the beach, don’t forget to pack your swimsuit, towel, sunscreen and sunglasses.</p><br /><h2>Winter sun holidays: what to expect when you arrive</h2><br /><p>

When you arrive at your winter sun holiday destination, you can expect to find warm weather and plenty of sunshine. Most winter sun holidays are in locations near the equator, so you can expect the temperatures to be quite warm. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when you are packing for your trip.

First, while the daytime temperatures may be warm, the evenings can be quite cool. So, be sure to pack a sweater or jacket for evenings out. Secondly, because you will be spending time in the sun, be sure to pack sunscreen and a hat to protect yourself from the sun’s rays. Finally, if you plan on doing any swimming while on your holiday, be sure to pack a swimsuit and towel.</p><br /><h2>Winter sun holidays: how to make the most of your trip</h2><br /><p>
If you’re planning a winter sun holiday, there are a few things you can do to make the most of your trip. From choosing the right destination to packing the right clothes, here’s everything you need to know.

### Choosing the right destination

Not all winter sun destinations are created equal. When picking your perfect getaway, consider factors like average temperature, rainfall and humidity. For example, if you’re looking for warm weather, the Canary Islands are a great option, with temperatures averaging around 20 degrees Celsius in December. On the other hand, if you prefer drier conditions, Arizona in the United States is a great choice, with very little rainfall and low humidity levels.

### Packing the right clothes

Once you’ve picked your destination, it’s time to start packing. When it comes to clothes, light and airy fabrics are key – think cottons, linens and denim. And don’t forget to pack your sunscreen! Even though it’s winter, the sun can be surprisingly strong in places like Australia and South Africa.

### Making the most of your trip

Finally, once you’ve arrived at your destination, there are a few things you can do to make sure you have a great time. First of all, take advantage of any free activities on offer – many hotels and resorts have complimentary yoga classes or walking groups. And secondly, remember to schedule some downtime – after all, a big part of the appeal of a winter sun holiday is being able to relax and recharge away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.</p><br /><h2>Winter sun holidays: what to do if you get homesick</h2><br /><p>

When the nights start to draw in and the weather gets colder, it can be easy to start feeling a bit down. If you're someone who hates the cold and longs for the warm days of summer, you might start to feel a bit homesick for sunnier climes.

One way to combat this is to book a winter sun holiday. This can be anything from a week in Spain to a month in Thailand - somewhere that will give you a much-needed dose of Vitamin D and help you forget all about the grey skies at home.

However, even when you're on holiday it's perfectly normal to experience a pang of homesickness now and again. Here are some tips on how to deal with it:

\- Stay in touch with your friends and family back home - a quick text or call will help you feel more connected.
\- Make an effort to meet new people - chat to your fellow holidaymakers, go on group tours or sign up for activities.
\- Keep yourself busy - fill your days with sightseeing, exploring, swimming, sunbathing...anything that will stop you from dwelling on thoughts of home.
\- Use technology to your advantage - there are now plenty of apps and websites that can help reduce feelings of homesickness (e.g. Skype, What's App, Facebook groups).
\- Write down your positive thoughts - each day, make a list of things you're grateful for about your holiday so far (e.g. the weather, the food, the accommodation). This will help shift your focus from negative to positive thoughts.</p><br /><h2>Winter sun holidays: how to stay safe while on your trip</h2><br /><p>
When you’re planning a winter sun holiday, there are a few things you need to take into account to make sure you stay safe while you’re away. Here are our top tips:

\- Buy travel insurance that covers you for all the activities you’ll be doing on your trip.

\- Make sure your vaccinations are up to date. Check with your GP or travel clinic 8 weeks before you travel.

\- Pack sunscreen and lip balm with a high SPF, even if it’s cloudy. Snow reflects the sun’s rays, so you can still get burnt.

\- Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration – at least 2 litres a day. Avoid alcohol and caffeine as they can dehydrate you.

\- Dress in layers so you can adjust to changes in temperature throughout the day. Wear loose, comfortable clothing that won’t irritate your skin if it gets hot.

\- Protect your eyes from the sun with sunglasses that have UV400 protection.</p><br /><h2>Winter sun holidays: how to cope with jet lag</h2><br /><p>Whether you’re planning a short break or a longer stay, there are a few things you can do to try and avoid that feeling of disorientation and lethargy caused by flying across several time zones.

On the plane, drink plenty of fluids (avoiding caffeine and alcohol), and where possible, walk around the cabin every few hours to keep your circulation going. When you arrive at your destination, try to get some natural sunlight as soon as possible – even if it’s just taking a short walk outside.

If you’re struggling to sleep at night, stick to a regular bedtime routine as much as possible, avoid napping during the day, and try using an eye mask and earplugs to create a dark, peaceful environment. It may also help to expose yourself to natural light first thing in the morning.

jet lag can be frustrating, but with a bit of planning and common sense, it doesn’t have to ruin your holiday.</p>
