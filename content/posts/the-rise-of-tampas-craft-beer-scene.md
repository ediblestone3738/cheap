The Rise of Tampa's Craft Beer Scene

Tampa, Florida has always been a popular vacation destination, offering warm weather year-round, beautiful beaches, and plenty of entertainment options. Recently, however, a new draw has emerged, making Tampa a must-visit destination for beer lovers – the city's booming craft beer scene.

Once upon a time, the beer scene in Tampa was dominated by big-name breweries, with few options for those looking for something different. Now, however, the city is home to a wide variety of craft breweries, each offering unique and delicious brews that showcase the creativity and passion of their creators.

From small, local operations to larger, well-established breweries with regional followings, Tampa's craft beer scene is a testament to the skill and dedication of its brewers. In this article, we'll explore the rise of Tampa's craft beer scene, from its humble beginnings to its present-day status as a must-visit destination for beer enthusiasts.

The Early Days

The craft beer movement began in the United States in the 1970s, with a few pioneering breweries such as Anchor Brewing Company in San Francisco, Sierra Nevada Brewing Company in California, and Boston Beer Company in Massachusetts. However, it wasn't until the 1990s that craft beer really started to take off.

In Tampa, the first craft brewery to open its doors was the Tampa Bay Brewing Company, in 1995. Owner John Doble had been a homebrewer for years before deciding to turn his hobby into a business. Today, Tampa Bay Brewing Company is still going strong, offering a wide variety of beers brewed on-site, along with delicious food in its brewpub.

Other breweries soon followed, including Cigar City Brewing in 2007, which became a local favorite thanks to its innovative and unique brews such as Jai Alai IPA, Florida Cracker Belgian-style White Ale, and Hunahpu's Imperial Stout. New breweries continued to pop up throughout the 2010s, including 7venth Sun Brewery, Coppertail Brewing Co., and Angry Chair Brewing.

The Present-Day Scene

Today, Tampa's craft beer scene is thriving. With over 40 breweries operating in the area, there's no shortage of options for beer lovers. These breweries range from small taprooms tucked away in industrial parks to large, bustling production facilities with expansive outdoor spaces.

One of the best things about Tampa's craft beer scene is the variety. From hoppy IPAs to smooth stouts, sour beers to crisp lagers, there's something for every palate. And with so many breweries to choose from, it's easy to find a favorite.

The rise of the craft beer scene in Tampa has also led to a number of beer-centric events throughout the year. One of the biggest is Tampa Bay Beer Week, which takes place every March and features special releases, tap takeovers, and events at breweries throughout the area. Other popular events include the Florida Brewers Guild Festival, held in Tampa in March, and the annual Hunahpu's Day festival at Cigar City Brewing in March, which attracts beer enthusiasts from across the country.
