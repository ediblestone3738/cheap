New York, also known as the Big Apple or the City that never sleeps, is one of the most iconic and visited cities in the world. It is a hub of culture, business, arts, and entertainment. With its towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, it is easy to forget that the city is steeped in a rich and fascinating history. In this travel article, we will take a closer look at the history of New York City, discover some of its hidden gems, and learn about its top 10 tourist attractions.

History of New York City

New York City's history dates back to the 1600s when it was first founded by the Dutch. Originally named New Amsterdam, it served as a trading post for fur traders. A few years later, the British seized the territory and renamed it New York in honor of the Duke of York.

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the city experienced significant growth and development, and its cultural and economic influence spread across the country and the world. From the rise of industry and finance to the struggles of the working class, New York has played a pivotal role in shaping America's history.

Another must-see attraction is the African Burial Ground National Monument, located in the Financial District. It was rediscovered in the 1990s, and since then, archeologists have discovered over 400 skeletons of people of African descent who were buried there in the 1700s.
