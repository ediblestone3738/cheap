# Do Hotel Prices Go Up the More You Search?

As a travel expert, I often get asked if hotel prices go up the more you search. The answer is yes, but it’s not as simple as it sounds.

Most hotels use revenue management software and other algorithms to automatically update their hotel room rates. If you search different dates for the same location you will notice that hotel prices can go up and down from day to day.

## Why Do Hotel Prices Change?

Hotel prices change for a variety of reasons. For example, hotels may raise prices when they know that demand is high, such as during holidays or special events. They may also lower prices when they know that demand is low, such as during the off-season.

Hotels also use algorithms to track how often a particular room is searched. If a room is searched multiple times, the hotel may raise the price in order to maximize their profits.

## How Can You Avoid Paying More?

If you want to avoid paying more for a hotel room, there are a few things you can do. First, try to book your hotel room as far in advance as possible. This will help you get the best rate, as hotels tend to raise prices as the date of your stay approaches.

You should also try to be flexible with your travel dates. If you’re able to stay a few days earlier or later than your original dates, you may be able to get a better rate.

Finally, you should consider using a hotel comparison website. These websites allow you to compare prices from multiple hotels in one place, so you can easily find the best deal.

## Conclusion

Hotel prices can go up the more you search, but there are ways to avoid paying more. Booking your hotel room as far in advance as possible, being flexible with your travel dates, and using a hotel comparison website can all help you get the best rate.

If you’re looking for a great deal on a hotel room, remember to keep these tips in mind. Happy travels!
