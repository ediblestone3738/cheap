# What is the Difference Between a Motel and an Inn?

Are you looking for a place to stay while you’re on the road? If so, you’ve probably heard of motels and inns. But what’s the difference between the two? In this article, we’ll take a look at the differences between motels and inns, so you can make an informed decision about where to stay.

## Motels

Motels are a type of lodging that typically offer basic amenities and are located along highways and other major roads. They are often the most affordable option for travelers, as they tend to be less expensive than hotels and inns. Motels usually offer single-room accommodations with a bed, bathroom, and television. Some motels may also offer a small kitchenette or other amenities.

## Inns

Inns are a type of lodging that is typically more expensive than motels. They are usually located in more rural areas and are often decorated by the owners. Inns usually offer more amenities than motels, such as a restaurant, bar, or lounge. They also tend to have a more homey feel than brand-name chains. The cost of staying at an inn usually falls between a motel and hotel. Inns will almost always be more expensive than a motel and rarely cost as much a hotel.

## Conclusion

When it comes to choosing between a motel and an inn, it really depends on your budget and what kind of amenities you’re looking for. Motels are usually the most affordable option and offer basic amenities, while inns are usually more expensive and offer more amenities. No matter which type of lodging you choose, you’ll be sure to find a comfortable place to stay.
