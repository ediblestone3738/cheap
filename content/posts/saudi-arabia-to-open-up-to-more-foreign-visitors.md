Saudi Arabia, the largest country in the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a popular destination for Muslim pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. However, over the past few years, the Saudi government has been making efforts to increase tourism in the country and open up to more foreign visitors. In this article, we will explore the recent changes in Saudi Arabia's tourism industry, answer some frequently asked questions, and share the top 10 tourist attractions in the country.

Recent Changes in Saudi Arabia's Tourism Industry

In September 2019, Saudi Arabia launched the "Sharek" visa program, which allowed tourists from 49 countries to apply for a visa online or upon arrival at any of the country's airports. This was a significant change as previously, the country only allowed entry to those who were on pilgrimage to Mecca or had business connections in the country.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Saudi Arabia suspended international tourism, but the country is now gearing up to restart its tourism industry with several new projects in the works. The government has committed to investing $64 billion in developing entertainment and tourism projects over the next decade, including a mega-resort on the Red Sea coast, an entertainment city near Riyadh, and a futuristic city called "NEOM" in the northwest of the country.

The Saudis have also been making efforts to improve the image of the country and its tourism sector. In 2019, they launched a new visa system that would allow women to apply for tourism visas without needing a male guardian. The government has also loosened some of the strict social codes that governed public life in the country, making it easier and more welcoming for foreigners to visit.
