# How to Make the Most of Holiday 2023

As a travel expert, I understand how important it is to make the most of your annual leave. With the right planning, you can make the most of your holiday in 2023 and enjoy a longer break for the same amount of leave. Here are my top tips for getting the most out of your holiday in 2023.

## Plan Ahead

The key to making the most of your holiday in 2023 is to plan ahead. Take some time to look at the calendar and see which days you can take off work to get the most out of your break. One of the best ways to maximise your annual leave in 2023 is to fly out on the Saturday before a bank holiday Monday, and come home the following Sunday. This way you're getting a nine-day break in exchange for just four days of annual leave.

## Take Advantage of Long Weekends

Another great way to make the most of your holiday in 2023 is to take advantage of long weekends. Look for opportunities to take a few days off work and extend your break. For example, if you take off the Friday before a bank holiday Monday, you can get a five-day break for just two days of annual leave.

## Take a Staycation

If you don't have the time or money to travel abroad, why not take a staycation? There are plenty of great places to explore in the UK, from the stunning beaches of Cornwall to the vibrant cities of London and Manchester. You can also take advantage of special offers and discounts on accommodation and attractions to make your staycation even more affordable.

## Book Early

If you're planning to travel abroad in 2023, it's important to book your flights and accommodation as early as possible. Airlines and hotels often offer early bird discounts, so it pays to book early and save money. Plus, you'll have more choice when it comes to flights and accommodation, so you can find the perfect holiday for you.

## Look for Deals

If you're looking to save money on your holiday in 2023, it pays to shop around and look for deals. Sign up to travel websites and newsletters to get the latest offers and discounts. You can also use price comparison websites to find the best deals on flights and accommodation.

## Be Flexible

If you're looking for the best deals on flights and accommodation, it pays to be flexible. Consider travelling at different times of the year or to different destinations. You may find that you can get a better deal if you're willing to be flexible.

## Make the Most of Your Time

Finally, make the most of your time on holiday. Don't waste your days lounging around the pool or lying on the beach. Instead, explore the local area, try new activities, and make the most of your time away.

Making the most of your holiday in 2023 doesn't have to be difficult. With the right planning and a bit of flexibility, you can make the most of your annual leave and enjoy a longer break for the same amount of leave. So, what are you waiting for? Start planning your holiday today and make the most of 2023!

Happy travels!
