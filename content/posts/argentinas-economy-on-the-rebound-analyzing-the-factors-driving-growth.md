# Argentina’s Economy on the Rebound: Analyzing the Factors Driving Growth

Argentina, one of South America’s largest countries, has been struggling to revive its economy for several years. The country has been through a series of financial crises, with the most recent being a currency crisis in 2018. However, the country’s economy is now on the rebound and is showing signs of growth. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the factors driving Argentina’s economic recovery and the potential implications for the country’s future.

## The Current State of the Economy

The Argentine economy is currently in a period of growth, with the country’s GDP increasing by 2.5% in 2019. This is the highest rate of growth since 2011, and it is expected to continue to grow in 2020.

The country’s unemployment rate has also decreased, from 9.7% in 2018 to 8.2% in 2019. This is the lowest unemployment rate since 2013.

Inflation has also been on the decline, with the annual rate falling from 47.6% in 2018 to 25.7% in 2019. This is the lowest inflation rate since 2013.

## Factors Driving Growth

There are several factors that are driving the growth of the Argentine economy.

The first is the introduction of a new currency, the peso argentino, in 2019. This new currency has helped to stabilize the economy and has made it easier for businesses and individuals to conduct transactions in the country.

The second is the government’s fiscal reforms, which have helped to reduce the country’s budget deficit. The government has been able to reduce the deficit by cutting spending, raising taxes, and introducing new taxes.

The third factor is the government’s economic stimulus package, which was introduced in 2018. This package included tax cuts, increased spending on infrastructure, and other measures designed to stimulate the economy.

The fourth factor is the increase in foreign investment in the country. Foreign investors have been attracted to Argentina due to its relatively low cost of doing business, as well as its large and growing population.

Finally, the fifth factor is the increase in exports. Argentina has been able to increase its exports due to the devaluation of the peso, which has made its exports more competitive on the global market.

## Implications for the Future

The current economic growth in Argentina is a positive sign for the country’s future. The government’s fiscal reforms and economic stimulus package have helped to stabilize the economy, while the introduction of the peso argentino has made it easier for businesses and individuals to conduct transactions.

In addition, the increase in foreign investment and exports has helped to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. This, in turn, is helping to reduce the country’s budget deficit and improve the country’s overall economic outlook.
