# Do Holiday Prices Go Up If You Keep Searching?

Have you ever been searching for a holiday and noticed that the prices keep going up? You may have heard the theory that the more you look at flights, the higher the costs get. This has led many people to believe that the websites they use to search for holidays are tracking their browsing history and bumping up the prices accordingly.

## What Does the Data Say?

Recent data suggests that this theory is not true. The websites you use to search for holidays are not tracking your browsing history and bumping up the prices. In fact, the data suggests that the prices of flights and holidays remain relatively stable, regardless of how often you search for them.

## How Can You Find the Best Deals?

So, if the websites you use to search for holidays are not tracking your browsing history and bumping up the prices, how can you find the best deals? The answer is simple: shop around. Don’t just stick to one website; use multiple websites to compare prices and find the best deals.

## The Benefits of Shopping Around

Shopping around for the best deals has a number of benefits. Firstly, it allows you to compare prices from different websites and find the best deal. Secondly, it allows you to find the best deals on flights and holidays that may not be available on the website you’re using. Finally, it allows you to find deals that may not be advertised on the website you’re using.

## Tips for Finding the Best Deals

If you’re looking for the best deals on flights and holidays, here are a few tips to help you find them:

- Sign up for price alerts. Many websites offer price alerts, which will notify you when the price of a flight or holiday drops.
- Be flexible with your dates. Prices can vary depending on the dates you choose, so be flexible and see if you can find a better deal.
- Book early. Prices tend to go up the closer you get to the date of travel, so book early to get the best deals.
- Check different websites. Don’t just stick to one website; use multiple websites to compare prices and find the best deals.

## Conclusion

So, does your browsing history bump up the price? Recent data suggests that this is not true. The websites you use to search for holidays are not tracking your browsing history and bumping up the prices. The best way to find the best deals is to shop around and compare prices from different websites. By following these tips, you can find the best deals on flights and holidays.
