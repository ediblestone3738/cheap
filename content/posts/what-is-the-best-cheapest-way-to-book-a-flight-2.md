# What is the Best Cheapest Way to Book a Flight?

As a travel expert, I often get asked what the best and cheapest way to book a flight is. The answer is not always straightforward, as there are a few different factors to consider. In this blog post, I will provide some tips and advice on how to find the best deals on flights and how to book them in the most cost-effective way.

## Book Directly Through the Airline's Website

More often than not, booking directly through the airline's website will give you the best price, or will at least be the same as the OTAs (online travel agencies). This is because airlines often offer exclusive discounts and deals that are not available through third-party sites. Some airlines, like Southwest, won't even show up on sites like Expedia or Orbitz, so you have to book direct. It can also be the most simple way to book, as you don't have to worry about navigating multiple sites to find the best deal.

## Compare Prices on Multiple Sites

It's always a good idea to compare prices on multiple sites before booking a flight. This is because different sites may have different prices for the same flight. For example, one site may have a cheaper fare than another, or one site may offer a discount that the other doesn't. By comparing prices on multiple sites, you can ensure that you get the best deal.

## Book in Advance

Booking your flight in advance is one of the best ways to get the cheapest fare. Airlines typically offer lower fares for flights that are booked several weeks or months in advance. This is because they want to fill up their planes as much as possible, so they offer discounted fares to those who book early.

## Be Flexible with Your Travel Dates

Being flexible with your travel dates can also help you get the best deal on a flight. Airlines often offer discounts for flights that are booked during off-peak times, such as mid-week or during the shoulder season. If you can be flexible with your travel dates, you may be able to find a cheaper fare.

## Sign Up for Airline Newsletters

Signing up for airline newsletters is another great way to get the best deals on flights. Airlines often send out exclusive discounts and promotions to their subscribers, so it's worth signing up for their newsletters to get the best deals.

## Use a Flight Search Engine

Using a flight search engine is also a great way to find the best deals on flights. Flight search engines like Skyscanner and Kayak search multiple sites to find the best deals, so you don't have to manually compare prices on different sites.

## Conclusion

Finding the best and cheapest way to book a flight can be a bit of a challenge, but it's not impossible. By following the tips and advice outlined in this blog post, you should be able to find the best deals on flights and book them in the most cost-effective way. Good luck and happy travels!
