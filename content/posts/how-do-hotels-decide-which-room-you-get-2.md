# How Do Hotels Decide Which Room You Get?

When you check into a hotel, the front desk agents are the ones who decide which room you get. They will choose from the available inventory, and depending on your preferences, you may be able to get a better room. If you call the hotel beforehand, you can talk to a front desk clerk and ask about the best rooms, such as corner rooms, rooms on higher floors, and rooms away from the elevators and ice machines.

## The Room Inventory

The front desk agents will have access to the hotel's room inventory. This inventory will list all the available rooms, their features, and their rates. The agents will be able to look through the inventory and decide which room best fits your needs.

## Your Preferences

When you check in, the front desk agents will ask you about your preferences. Do you prefer a room with a view? Are you looking for a quiet room away from the elevators? Do you need a room with two beds? The front desk agents will take your preferences into consideration when choosing a room for you.

## Priority Bookings

Hotels often give priority to certain bookings. For example, if you are a member of the hotel's loyalty program, you may be given priority when it comes to room selection. The same goes for bookings made through travel agents or other third-party websites.

## Special Requests

If you have any special requests, such as a room with a Jacuzzi or a room with a balcony, you can ask the front desk agents. They will do their best to accommodate your requests, but they may not be able to fulfill them due to availability.

## Upgrade Fees

Some hotels may offer you the option to upgrade your room for an additional fee. This fee can vary depending on the hotel and the type of room you are upgrading to. If you are interested in upgrading your room, you can ask the front desk agents for more information.

## Conclusion

When you check into a hotel, the front desk agents are the ones who decide which room you get. They will choose from the available inventory, and depending on your preferences, you may be able to get a better room. If you call the hotel beforehand, you can talk to a front desk clerk and ask about the best rooms, such as corner rooms, rooms on higher floors, and rooms away from the elevators and ice machines. The front desk agents will also take into consideration any special requests you may have, as well as any upgrade fees you may be willing to pay.
