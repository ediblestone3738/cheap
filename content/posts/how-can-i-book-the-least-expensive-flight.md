# How to Find Cheap Flights in 2022: The Ultimate Guide

Traveling is one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences in life, but it can also be expensive. If you’re looking to save money on flights in 2022, you’ve come to the right place. This guide will show you how to find the least expensive flights and save money on your next trip.

## Pick Your Destination and Dates Based on Price

The first step to finding the least expensive flight is to pick your destination and dates based on price. Start by researching the average cost of flights to your desired destination. Then, look for the cheapest days to fly. Generally, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are the least expensive days to fly. Additionally, you can often find cheaper flights if you’re willing to be flexible with your dates.

## Use the Best Flight Search Sites

Once you’ve determined your destination and dates, it’s time to start searching for flights. There are many flight search sites available, but some are better than others. For example, Skyscanner and Google Flights are two of the most popular flight search sites. They offer a wide selection of flights and allow you to compare prices quickly and easily.

## Find the Cheapest Place to Fly with the Google Flights Explore Map

The Google Flights Explore Map is a great tool for finding the least expensive flights. It allows you to search for flights to multiple destinations at once and compare prices. Simply enter your desired departure and arrival cities, and the map will show you the cheapest places to fly.

## Be Flexible—Even by a Few Days—to Save More

If you’re willing to be flexible with your dates, you can often save a lot of money. Even a difference of a few days can make a big difference in the cost of your flight. For example, if you’re flying from New York to Los Angeles, you may find that the cost of the flight is significantly cheaper if you leave on a Wednesday instead of a Tuesday.

## Travel on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Saturday

As mentioned earlier, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are usually the least expensive days to fly. If you’re able to be flexible with your travel dates, try to book your flight for one of these days. You may be able to save a significant amount of money.

## Book in Advance

Booking your flight in advance is another great way to save money. Airlines often offer discounts for early bookings, so try to book your flight at least two weeks in advance. Additionally, you can often find discounted fares if you book your flight during the off-season.

## Take Advantage of Flight Deals and Discounts

Finally, be sure to take advantage of flight deals and discounts. Airlines often offer special discounts and promotions, so keep an eye out for these. Additionally, many travel websites offer discounts and coupons for flights.

## Conclusion

Finding the least expensive flight doesn’t have to be difficult. By following the tips in this guide, you can save money on your next flight. Pick your destination and dates based on price, use the best flight search sites, find the cheapest place to fly with the Google Flights Explore Map, be flexible with your dates, travel on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Saturday, book in advance, and take advantage of flight deals and discounts. With a little bit of research and planning, you can find the least expensive flight for your next trip.
