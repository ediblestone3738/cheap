Sun, Sea, and Savings: How to Book an Affordable Holiday to the Greek Islands

The Greek Islands have always been an attractive destination for travelers from all over the world, with their picturesque beaches, crystal clear waters, and abundant history and culture. However, with the pandemic causing financial strain for many, finding an affordable holiday to the Greek Islands is more important than ever. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to save money without compromising on an amazing holiday experience. Here’s everything you need to know to book an affordable Greek Island adventure.

Choosing the Right Time to Travel

One of the most significant contributors to the cost of your Greek Island holiday is the season you choose to travel. The high season runs from mid-June to mid-September, with the peak of the season being July and August. During this time, you can expect accommodation and flight prices to be at their highest. However, if you’re flexible on your travel dates and don’t mind travelling during the low season, which is from October to May, you’ll find much cheaper deals on flights, accommodation, and activities.

Choosing the Perfect Greek Island

Greece has over 200 inhabited islands, each with its charm and beauty. However, depending on what you’re looking for, some islands may work out more affordable than others. The paradise island of Santorini might be a dream destination for many, but it’s also one of the most expensive islands in the country. On the other hand, islands like Lefkada and Naxos offer a similar experience at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, some islands have different peak seasons, so it’s worth doing some research into which islands are more affordable during the season you plan to travel.

Strategic Accommodation Booking

Another big contributor to the cost of your trip is the type of accommodation you choose. If you want to keep costs low, hostels, camping sites, and budget hotels are excellent choices for budget travelers. However, if you’re traveling with a group or family, budget villas that come with all the amenities you need can be a perfect fit. To find affordable accommodation, make use of discount booking sites, and look for deals and special offers.

Stay Local

Greek cuisine is world-renowned for its healthy, colorful, and delicious Mediterranean flair. Exploring the local cuisine is an essential part of your Greek Island adventure, and one of the most affordable ways to do this is to eat at local tavernas instead of fine dining restaurants. It is a more authentic experience, and you get to sample fresh and seasonal food that’s been locally sourced. To save extra money, you could also pack a few picnic lunches with cheap ingredients from a local supermarket.

Getting Around on the Islands

Hiring a car or motorcycle can indeed give you more freedom and allow for more exploration of the islands, but it’s also one of the most expensive ways to get around. Most Greek islands have an excellent public transport system, so instead of hiring a vehicle, you can use local buses, taxis, and even bike or hike to explore the island. Many islands also have bike and car rental services that offer more favorable rates for longer term use.

FAQs Section:

When is the Best Time to Book Your Flights?

It’s best to book your flights early, ideally around three to four months before your travel dates to secure the best deals.

Do I Need a Visa to Travel to Greece?

If you’re a citizen of a European Union country or Switzerland, you don’t need a visa to travel to Greece. If you’re from outside the EU, check online for specific visa requirements.

Are the Greek Islands Safe for Tourists?

Yes, the Greek Islands are incredibly safe for tourists. Pickpocketing and petty theft can be present, so it’s worth being cautious and taking standard safety precautions.

Can I Pay with Credit Cards or Cash in Greece?

Most shops, restaurants, and hotels on the Greek Islands accept credit cards, but it’s always a good idea to have some cash on you in case you come across places that don’t accept cards.

What is the Currency Used in Greece?

The Euro is the official currency used in Greece.
