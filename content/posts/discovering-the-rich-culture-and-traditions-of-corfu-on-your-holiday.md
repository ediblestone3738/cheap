History and Culture of Corfu

Corfu has a long and fascinating history, influenced by various civilizations over the centuries. From the ancient Greeks and Romans to the Venetians and British, each one has left its mark on the island. Today, you can still see the evidence of this rich heritage in the island's architecture, historic landmarks, and cultural traditions.

The Old Town of Corfu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and for good reason. The narrow streets are lined with charming buildings, many dating back to the Venetian period.

This grand 19th-century building now houses the Museum of Asian Art, which boasts over 10,000 pieces from China, Japan, and India.

On Resurrection Day, a custom called the "Botides" sees people throwing large, clay pots from their balconies, creating a loud and joyous noise.

Another essential part of Corfu's culture is the local cuisine. Due to the island's location between Italy and Greece, it has blended the best of both cuisines to create something unique. Traditional Corfiot dishes include sofrito, a veal dish cooked with white wine and garlic, and bourdeto, a fish stew with red pepper and tomato sauce. Don't forget to sample some of the island's famous olive oil and locally produced wines.
