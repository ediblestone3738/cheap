# What is the Cheapest Way to Go on Holiday?

Going on holiday can be expensive, but there are ways to save money and still have a great time. Here are 23 tips to help you cut the cost of your holiday and get the most out of your budget.

## 1\. Buy Cheap Flights with Price Comparison Search Engines

The cost of flights can make up a large portion of your holiday budget, so it pays to shop around. Price comparison search engines like Skyscanner and Kayak can help you find the best deals on flights. You can also set up price alerts so you can be notified when the price of a flight you’re interested in drops.

## 2\. Keep Within the Luggage Allowances

If you’re flying, make sure you’re aware of the airline’s luggage allowances. If you exceed the weight limit, you’ll be charged extra for your luggage. If you’re travelling light, you can often get away with taking just hand luggage, which can save you money.

## 3\. Avoid Extra In-Flight Costs

In-flight meals and drinks can be expensive, so it’s worth bringing your own snacks and drinks with you. If you’re flying long-haul, you may be able to get a meal deal from the airport, which can save you money.

## 4\. Travel by Coach or Train Instead of Flying

If you’re travelling within Europe, it can often be cheaper to travel by coach or train than to fly. Coach companies like Eurolines and Flixbus offer cheap fares, and you can often get discounted train tickets if you book in advance.

## 5\. Get Affordable Travel Insurance

Travel insurance is essential if you’re travelling abroad, but it can be expensive. Shop around to find the best deal, and make sure you read the small print to make sure you’re covered for the activities you’ll be doing.

## 14\. Use Free Attractions

Many cities have free attractions, so make sure you take advantage of them. Museums, galleries and parks are often free to visit, and they’re a great way to explore a new city.

Coupon sites like Groupon and LivingSocial offer discounts on attractions and activities. Sign up for an account and you can get money off your bookings.

## 20\. Take a Staycation

If you’re looking for a cheap holiday, why not take a staycation? You can explore your own city and save money on accommodation and travel costs.

## 21\. Book Early

If you’re planning a holiday, it pays to book early. Airlines and hotels often offer discounted rates for early bookings, so make sure you book as early as possible.

## 22\. Travel During the Off-Season
