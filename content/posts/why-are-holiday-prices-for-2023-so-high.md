# Why Are Holiday Prices for 2023 So High?

The holiday season of 2023 is already upon us, and many people are already looking to book their next getaway. However, there’s one thing that’s become apparent – the prices for holidays in 2023 are much higher than in previous years. So why are holiday prices for 2023 so high?

## The Impact of the Pandemic

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on the travel industry, with many airlines and hotels having to reduce their capacity or close down completely. This has led to a decrease in the number of flights and accommodation available, resulting in higher prices for those that are still available.

## High Demand

The high demand for holidays is also a factor driving up prices. With people desperate to get away after months of lockdowns and restrictions, they are willing to pay higher prices for the chance to escape. This has resulted in a “perfect storm of spiralling costs” according to Mr Boland, a travel expert.

## Inflationary Pressure

Inflationary pressure is another factor that is driving up the cost of holidays. As the cost of living increases, so do the prices of goods and services, including holidays. This means that the prices of holidays are likely to continue to rise in the coming months.

## What Can You Do?

If you’re looking to book a holiday for 2023, there are a few things you can do to try and get the best deal. Firstly, it’s important to book early. This will give you the best chance of getting the lowest prices, as airlines and hotels are likely to increase their prices as the date of your holiday approaches.

It’s also important to be flexible with your travel dates. If you’re able to travel at different times of the year, you may be able to find cheaper prices. Additionally, you should look out for any discounts or deals that may be available. Many airlines and hotels offer discounts and promotions throughout the year, so it’s worth keeping an eye out for these.

## Conclusion

The high prices of holidays for 2023 are due to a combination of factors, including the impact of the pandemic, high demand and inflationary pressure. However, there are still ways to get the best deal, such as booking early, being flexible with your travel dates and looking out for discounts and promotions.
