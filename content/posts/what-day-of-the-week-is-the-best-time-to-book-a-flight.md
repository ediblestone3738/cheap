# What Day of the Week is the Best Time to Book a Flight?

Traveling by air can be a great way to get to your destination quickly and comfortably. But with so many airlines and flight options, it can be hard to know when to book your flight to get the best deal. While airfare prices fluctuate based on when you book, midweek travel is likely cheaper than flying on weekends.

## Midweek Travel is Cheaper

According to Hopper data, “travelers who fly midweek, usually Wednesday, can save an average of $56 per ticket on domestic airfare throughout the year.” This means that if you’re looking to save money on your flight, you should try to book your flight on a Wednesday.

## Why is Midweek Travel Cheaper?

There are a few reasons why midweek travel is cheaper than weekend travel. For one, airlines tend to have fewer flights on weekdays than on weekends. This means that there is less competition for tickets, so airlines can charge less for flights. Additionally, airlines know that most people prefer to travel on weekends, so they are more likely to charge higher prices for those flights.

## Tips for Finding the Best Deals

If you’re looking to save money on your flight, there are a few tips you can follow to help you find the best deals. First, try to book your flight as far in advance as possible. Airlines tend to offer the best prices for flights that are booked at least two weeks in advance. Additionally, try to be flexible with your travel dates. Airlines often offer discounts for flights that are booked on certain days of the week or at certain times of the day.

## Booking Through a Travel Agent

If you’re having trouble finding the best deals on your own, you may want to consider booking your flight through a travel agent. Travel agents are experienced in finding the best deals on flights and can often get you discounts that you wouldn’t be able to find on your own. Additionally, they can help you find the best route for your trip and can provide advice on the best times to fly.

## Conclusion

When it comes to booking a flight, midweek travel is usually the cheapest option. Airlines tend to have fewer flights on weekdays, so they can charge less for tickets. Additionally, they know that most people prefer to travel on weekends, so they are more likely to charge higher prices for those flights. If you’re looking to save money on your flight, try to book your flight on a Wednesday and be flexible with your travel dates. You may also want to consider booking your flight through a travel agent, as they can often get you discounts that you wouldn’t be able to find on your own.
