# Hungary’s Economic Resilience Amidst Global Pandemic

The global pandemic has caused significant economic disruption and hardship in many countries, but Hungary has been one of the few countries to emerge relatively unscathed. Despite the pandemic, Hungary’s economy has remained resilient and has even seen a slight uptick in growth. This is due to the country’s strong fiscal policies, proactive government measures, and a diversified economy.

## The Impact of the Pandemic on Hungary’s Economy

The pandemic has had a significant impact on Hungary’s economy, with GDP declining by 7.1% in 2020. This was largely due to the country’s reliance on tourism, as well as its export-oriented manufacturing sector. However, the country’s economy has been able to rebound quickly due to a number of proactive measures taken by the government.

## Government Measures to Mitigate the Impact of the Pandemic

The Hungarian government has taken a number of measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the economy. These include:

• Extending the wage subsidy scheme, which provides support to businesses affected by the pandemic;

• Providing tax relief for businesses, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 9% to 5%;

• Increasing public investment in infrastructure and other projects;

• Introducing a “green loan” scheme to provide businesses with access to financing;

• Establishing a “resilience fund” to provide additional support to businesses;

• Establishing a “job protection scheme” to help businesses retain employees; and

• Introducing a “job creation scheme” to help businesses create new jobs.

These measures have helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the economy, and have allowed the country to remain resilient despite the global crisis.

## The Benefits of a Diversified Economy

Another factor that has contributed to Hungary’s economic resilience is the country’s diversified economy. Hungary’s economy is not reliant on any one sector, but is instead comprised of a number of different industries. This has allowed the country to weather the pandemic better than many other countries, as it has been able to rely on other sectors to offset losses in the tourism and manufacturing sectors.

## The Outlook for 2021

The outlook for Hungary’s economy in 2021 is positive, with the government expecting GDP to grow by 4.5%. This is due to the government’s proactive measures, as well as the country’s diversified economy. The tourism sector is expected to recover quickly, as the country is now offering free COVID-19 tests to tourists. This should help to stimulate the economy and drive growth in 2021.
