Planning a holiday can be an exciting yet stressful experience. From researching the best destination to booking flights and accommodation, there are a lot of decisions to make. One of the most important decisions is when to book. With the right timing, you can save a lot of money on your holiday.

## When is the Best Day to Book a Package Holiday?

It turns out that the best day to book a package holiday is on a Monday. A former Thomas Cook insider revealed that the company always offers their best deals on a Monday. This is because the prices are sometimes dropped to entice customers who have received a quote over the weekend, but not completed a booking.

## What Other Tips Can Help Me Save Money on My Holiday?

There are several other tips that can help you save money on your holiday. Here are a few of the most effective ones:

- Book flights and accommodation separately – Booking flights and accommodation separately can often be cheaper than booking a package holiday. This is because you can shop around for the best deals on each component.
- Be flexible with your dates – Being flexible with your dates can help you save money. For example, flying on a Tuesday or Wednesday is usually cheaper than flying on a Friday or Saturday.
- Book in advance – Booking your holiday in advance can help you get the best deals. Airlines and hotels often offer discounts for early bookings.
- Check for discounts – Always check for discounts before booking your holiday. Airlines and hotels often offer discounts for students, seniors, and military personnel.

## Conclusion

Booking a holiday can be a stressful experience, but it doesn't have to be. By following the tips above, you can save a lot of money on your holiday. The best day to book a package holiday is on a Monday, as the prices are sometimes dropped to entice customers who have received a quote over the weekend, but not completed a booking.

Happy travels!
