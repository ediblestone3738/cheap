# Should I Book My 2023 Holiday Now or Wait?

Before you go on holiday this summer, spare a thought for your unborn holiday in the summer of 2023. If you want to get a good deal on one, travel chiefs are advising that you book now. That's because travel costs are set to soar in 2023, so it could be wise to book your holiday before then.

## Why Should I Book My 2023 Holiday Now?

The main reason to book your 2023 holiday now is to save money. Travel costs are expected to increase significantly in 2023, so booking now could save you a lot of money. This is especially true if you're planning to go to a popular destination, as prices are likely to rise even more in those areas.

Another reason to book your 2023 holiday now is to get the best selection of flights and accommodation. Airlines and hotels are likely to be more crowded in 2023, so booking now will give you more options and better availability.

Finally, booking your 2023 holiday now will give you more time to plan and prepare. You'll have plenty of time to research the best places to visit, find the best deals, and make sure you have all the necessary documents and vaccinations.

## What Are the Risks of Booking My 2023 Holiday Now?

The main risk of booking your 2023 holiday now is that you may have to change your plans. If something unexpected happens, such as a pandemic or a natural disaster, you may have to cancel or postpone your trip. This could mean losing your deposit or having to pay additional fees.

Another risk is that you may not be able to get a refund if you have to cancel your trip. Airlines and hotels often have strict cancellation policies, so you may not be able to get your money back if you have to cancel.

Finally, there is always the risk that prices could go down in 2023. If you book now, you may end up paying more than you would have if you had waited.

## Should I Book My 2023 Holiday Now or Wait?

Ultimately, the decision to book your 2023 holiday now or wait is up to you. If you want to save money and get the best selection of flights and accommodation, then booking now could be the best option. However, if you're willing to take the risk of prices going down, then waiting could be the better choice.

No matter what you decide, make sure to book your 2023 holiday before 29 Mar 2022. After that date, prices are likely to start increasing significantly.

## Conclusion

If you're planning a holiday in 2023, it could be wise to book now. Travel costs are expected to increase significantly in 2023, so booking now could save you a lot of money. However, there are risks involved, so make sure to weigh the pros and cons before making your decision.

No matter what you decide, make sure to book your 2023 holiday before 29 Mar 2022. After that date, prices are likely to start increasing significantly.
