# How Far Out is the Cheapest Time to Book a Flight?

In addition to the optimal booking window, there are a few other factors to consider when booking a flight. For example, prices tend to be higher on weekends and during peak travel times, such as holidays. It’s also important to keep an eye on the exchange rate, as this can affect the cost of a flight.

You can also sign up for email alerts from airlines and travel sites to be notified of any deals or discounts.
