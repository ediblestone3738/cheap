Taiwan's Role in the Global Fight Against Climate Change

Taiwan may be a tiny island, but its contribution to the global fight against climate change cannot be underestimated. With its advanced technology and proactive policies, Taiwan has been working tirelessly to reduce its carbon footprint and promote sustainable practices. From green energy to recycling and eco-tourism, Taiwan is proving that a small country can make a big difference in the fight against climate change.

Green Energy

Taiwan is leading the way in green energy, with a goal to increase the proportion of renewable energy to 20% of total energy production by 2025. In recent years, Taiwan has made significant strides in the development of wind, solar and hydro power, and has become a major player in the global renewable energy market.

Wind Power

Taiwan is rapidly becoming a hub for offshore wind power, with a goal of generating 15.5 GW of wind power by 2035. The government has invested heavily in the industry, with plans to build new wind farms and expand existing ones. Taiwan's offshore wind projects are not only reducing carbon emissions but also creating jobs and boosting the economy.

Solar Power

Taiwan is also making significant progress in the development of solar power. In 2020, Taiwan ranked sixth in the world for solar cell production, and it is aiming to increase its capacity to over 20GW by 2025. The government has implemented policies to encourage the installation of solar panels on homes and businesses, and has also initiated large-scale solar power projects in rural areas.

Hydro Power

Hydro power is another important source of renewable energy in Taiwan, with dozens of hydroelectric plants located throughout the island. Taiwan has also developed several pumped-storage hydroelectricity plants, which allow excess energy created by wind or solar projects to be stored and used during peak demand times.

Recycling

Taiwan has a long history of promoting recycling and waste reduction, with the government implementing policies to reduce waste and encourage recycling since the 1990s. As a result, Taiwan has one of the highest recycling rates in the world, with over 55% of waste being recycled. The government has also introduced a ban on single-use plastics, and encourages the use of reusable bags and containers.

Eco-tourism

Taiwan's commitment to sustainability extends to its tourism industry. The island has a wealth of natural resources and eco-tourism destinations, from stunning mountain ranges to pristine beaches and coastline. Visitors can enjoy activities such as cycling, hiking, and bird-watching while learning about Taiwan's efforts to promote conservation and reduce carbon emissions.
