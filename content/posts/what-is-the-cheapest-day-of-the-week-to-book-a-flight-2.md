# What is the Cheapest Day of the Week to Book a Flight?

As a travel expert, I'm often asked what is the cheapest day of the week to book a flight. The answer to this question can vary depending on the time of year, the destination, and the airline, but there are some general rules of thumb that can help you save money when booking a flight.

## Early to Midweek is Generally Cheaper

When it comes to booking a flight, early to midweek tends to be the cheapest days to fly. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are usually the least expensive days to book a flight, as these days tend to be less busy than the weekends. If you're looking to save money, it's best to avoid booking a flight on Fridays and Sundays, as these days tend to be the most expensive.

## Off-Peak Days are Best

Another way to save money when booking a flight is to look for off-peak days. Off-peak days are usually days that are not as popular for travel, such as Mondays and Thursdays. These days tend to be cheaper than peak days, so if you're looking to save money, it's best to book your flight on an off-peak day.

## Busier Weekends are More Expensive

It's also important to keep in mind that the busier the weekend, the more expensive the flight is likely to be. For example, if you're looking to book a flight for the summer months, it's best to avoid booking a flight on the weekends, as these days tend to be more expensive.

## Book Early to Get the Best Deals

Finally, it's important to remember that the earlier you book your flight, the better the deals you're likely to get. Airlines often offer discounts for flights booked in advance, so if you're looking to save money, it's best to book your flight as early as possible.

## Conclusion

When it comes to booking a flight, there are a few general rules of thumb that can help you save money. Early to midweek tends to be cheaper on off-peak days, and as a rule of thumb, the busier the weekend, the more the flight is going to cost. “I've found that it is generally cheaper to fly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays,” adds Dengler. Additionally, it's important to book your flight as early as possible to get the best deals. With these tips in mind, you should be able to find the cheapest day of the week to book a flight.
