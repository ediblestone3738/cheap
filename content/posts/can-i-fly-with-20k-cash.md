# Can I Fly With 20k Cash?

Traveling with a large amount of cash can be intimidating, especially when it comes to international flights. If you’re wondering whether you can fly with 20k cash, the answer is yes, but there are certain rules and regulations you must follow.

## Can I Bring Any Amount of Money to the Airport?

The short answer is yes, you can bring any amount of money to the airport. It is not illegal to fly with a large amount of cash on a flight. However, it is important to note that if you are traveling on an international flight and have more than $10,000 in your possession, then you must disclose the amount of U.S. Currency in your possession on a FinCEN 105 form.

## What is a FinCEN 105 Form?

The FinCEN 105 form is a Currency and Monetary Instrument Report (CMIR) that is used to report the transportation of currency or monetary instruments of more than $10,000. The form must be completed and submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) prior to departure. The form must include the following information:

- Name of traveler
- Destination
- Type of currency or monetary instrument
- Amount of currency or monetary instrument
- Purpose of the transportation

## What Happens if I Don’t Declare My Currency?

If you fail to declare your currency or monetary instruments of more than $10,000, then you may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. The penalties for failing to declare currency or monetary instruments can include fines of up to $500,000 and/or imprisonment for up to five years.

## What Else Should I Know About Flying With Cash?

It is important to note that if you are carrying more than $10,000 in cash, you may be subject to additional scrutiny by the CBP. The CBP may ask questions about the source of the funds and may request additional documentation to verify the source of the funds. Additionally, the CBP may seize the funds if they believe the funds are related to illegal activities.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, it is not illegal to fly with a large amount of cash on a flight. However, if you are traveling on an international flight and have more than $10,000 in your possession, then you must disclose the amount of U.S. Currency in your possession on a FinCEN 105 form. Failure to declare currency or monetary instruments of more than $10,000 may result in civil and criminal penalties.
