Uncover the Hidden Beauty of Nature  

Belarus is a land of untouched natural beauty, with over a third of the country covered in pristine forests. As you roam through the legendary Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park, you’ll feel like you’ve stepped into a fairytale. With its ancient oak trees, roaming herds of European bison, and a sense of tranquility that envelops you, this national park is a nature lover's paradise.

For a different natural wonder, head to the breathtaking Braslaw Lakes, a stunning network of over 300 lakes nestled amidst rolling hills and lush greenery. Explore its hidden corners, take a boat ride, or simply relax on the shores and soak in the serenity of this picturesque landscape.

Discover a Rich Tapestry of History and Culture  

Belarus is a country steeped in history, and exploring its numerous castles and fortresses is like stepping back in time.

Its striking red brick exterior and whimsical towers will leave you in awe, making it a perfect destination for any history enthusiast.

To delve deeper into Belarus' past, wander through the historic center of Minsk, the capital city.

Embrace the Belarusian hospitality by indulging in traditional cuisine. Don't miss the opportunity to try draniki, Belarusian potato pancakes that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.
