# Can You Pay Monthly on Airbnb?

Traveling can be expensive, and when you’re booking a long-term stay, it can be difficult to come up with the full amount of money upfront. Fortunately, Airbnb offers a payment plan that allows you to pay for your stay in monthly installments. In this article, we’ll explain how you can pay monthly on Airbnb and the terms and conditions associated with this payment option.

## What is Airbnb?

Airbnb is an online marketplace that allows people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world. It’s a great way to find unique and affordable places to stay, whether you’re looking for a short-term rental or a long-term stay.

## Can You Pay Monthly on Airbnb?

Yes, you can pay monthly on Airbnb. Airbnb offers a payment plan that allows you to pay for your stay in monthly installments. The payment plan is available for reservations of 28 nights or longer.

## How Does the Payment Plan Work?

When you book a reservation of 28 nights or longer, you’ll be given the option to pay in monthly installments. You’ll be required to pay the first installment at the time of booking. The second payment will be charged to the same payment method approximately one month after check-in, and each month thereafter for the duration of your reservation.

## Are There Any Fees Associated with the Payment Plan?

Yes, there are fees associated with the payment plan. Airbnb charges a 3% fee for each installment payment. This fee is non-refundable and will be charged to the same payment method used for the installment payments.

## What Happens if I Miss a Payment?

If you miss a payment, Airbnb will attempt to collect the payment from the same payment method used for the installment payments. If the payment is not collected, Airbnb reserves the right to cancel your reservation and you will be responsible for any cancellation fees.

## What Happens if I Cancel My Reservation?

If you cancel your reservation, you will be responsible for any cancellation fees. If you cancel your reservation before the second installment is due, you will not be charged any additional fees. However, if you cancel your reservation after the second installment is due, you will be responsible for any remaining installment payments.

## Conclusion

Paying monthly on Airbnb is a great way to spread out the cost of your stay. However, it’s important to understand the terms and conditions associated with the payment plan, including any fees and cancellation policies. By understanding the payment plan, you can make sure you’re prepared for any potential fees or charges that may be associated with your reservation.
