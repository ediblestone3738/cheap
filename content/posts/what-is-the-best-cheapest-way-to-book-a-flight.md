# What is the Best Cheapest Way to Book a Flight?

Traveling by air is often the most convenient and efficient way to get from one place to another. But when it comes to booking a flight, it can be difficult to find the best and cheapest option. With so many websites and travel agencies offering different prices, it can be hard to know where to start. Fortunately, there are a few simple tips and tricks that can help you find the best and cheapest way to book a flight.

## Book Directly Through the Airline

More often than not, booking directly through the airline's website will give you the best price, or will at least be the same as the OTAs (online travel agencies). Some airlines, like Southwest, won't even show up on sites like Expedia or Orbitz, so you have to book direct. It can also be the most simple way to book.

## Compare Prices

The best way to find the cheapest flight is to compare prices. There are many websites and apps that allow you to compare prices from different airlines and travel agencies. It's important to compare prices from different sources to make sure you're getting the best deal. Some websites even allow you to set up alerts so you can be notified when the price of a flight drops.

## Be Flexible With Your Dates

Being flexible with your travel dates can also help you find the best and cheapest flights. Prices can vary greatly depending on the day and time of your flight, so it pays to be flexible. You may also be able to find cheaper flights if you're willing to fly on a different day or at a different time.

## Book Early

Booking your flight early can also help you get the best price. Airlines usually offer discounted fares for flights booked several weeks or months in advance. If you're planning a trip, it's best to book your flight as soon as possible to get the best deal.

## Sign Up for Airline Loyalty Programs

If you fly frequently, it may be worth signing up for an airline loyalty program. Many airlines offer loyalty programs that allow you to earn points or miles for every flight you take. These points can then be used to get discounts on future flights. Some airlines also offer special discounts and promotions for members of their loyalty programs.

## Use Credit Card Rewards

If you have a rewards credit card, you may be able to use your rewards points to book flights. Many credit cards offer rewards points that can be used to book flights or other travel expenses. It's important to check the terms and conditions of your credit card to make sure you're getting the best deal.

## Conclusion

Booking a flight can be a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be. By following these simple tips and tricks, you can find the best and cheapest way to book a flight. Whether you book directly through the airline, compare prices, or use credit card rewards, you can save money and get the best deal.
