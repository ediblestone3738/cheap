# How to Make the Most of Holiday 2023

As 2023 approaches, it’s time to start planning how to make the most of your annual leave. With only a limited number of days off, it’s important to plan your holiday strategically to get the most out of it. The best way to maximise your annual leave in 2023 is to fly out on the Saturday before a bank holiday Monday, and come home the following Sunday. This way you’re getting a nine-day break in exchange for just four days of annual leave.

## Planning Your Holiday

When planning your holiday, it’s important to think about where you want to go and what you want to do. Do you want to explore a new city, relax on a beach, or take a road trip? Once you’ve decided on a destination, you can start researching the best time to visit. For example, if you’re planning a beach holiday, you may want to avoid peak season when prices are higher and beaches are more crowded.

## Choosing the Right Dates

When choosing the dates for your holiday, you should aim to get the most out of your annual leave. The best way to do this is to fly out on the Saturday before a bank holiday Monday, and come home the following Sunday. This way you’re getting a nine-day break in exchange for just four days of annual leave.

For example, if you take four days of annual leave from the 23rd to the 26th of December 2022, you can fly out on the 22nd and come home on the 30th. This way you’re getting a nine-day holiday for the price of four days of annual leave.

## Booking Your Flight

Once you’ve chosen the dates for your holiday, it’s time to book your flight. The best way to get the best deal is to book early. Airlines often offer discounted fares for flights booked in advance, so you can save money by booking your flight as soon as possible.

It’s also important to compare prices between different airlines. Different airlines offer different prices for the same route, so it’s worth taking the time to compare prices and find the best deal.

## Accommodation

Once you’ve booked your flight, it’s time to start looking for accommodation. There are a variety of options available, from hotels to Airbnb rentals. Again, it’s important to compare prices between different options to get the best deal.

If you’re travelling with a group, you may want to consider renting a villa or apartment. This can be a great way to save money, as you can split the cost between a group of people.

## Making the Most of Your Holiday

Once you’ve booked your flight and accommodation, it’s time to start planning what you’re going to do on your holiday. Make sure to research the area and find out what attractions and activities are available.

It’s also important to plan ahead and book any activities or attractions in advance. This will ensure that you don’t miss out on anything and that you make the most of your holiday.

## Conclusion

Making the most of your holiday in 2023 is all about planning ahead and making the most of your annual leave. The best way to maximise your annual leave is to fly out on the Saturday before a bank holiday Monday, and come home the following Sunday. This way you’re getting a nine-day break in exchange for just four days of annual leave.
