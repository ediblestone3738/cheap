# US Deepens Involvement in Syrian Civil War

The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, has been a devastating conflict that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties, millions of refugees, and a humanitarian crisis. In recent years, the United States has become increasingly involved in the conflict, with President Donald Trump authorizing airstrikes and other military actions in Syria.

## Background of the Conflict

The Syrian Civil War began in 2011, when peaceful protests against the government of President Bashar al-Assad were met with a violent response by the Syrian government. The conflict quickly escalated into a full-fledged civil war, with the Syrian government, supported by Russia and Iran, fighting against rebel groups, backed by the United States, Turkey, and other countries.

The conflict has been devastating, with hundreds of thousands of people killed and millions of people displaced. It has also resulted in a humanitarian crisis, as millions of Syrians have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in neighboring countries.

## US Involvement in the Conflict

The United States has been involved in the Syrian Civil War since the beginning, providing military and financial support to rebel groups. In recent years, however, the US has become increasingly involved in the conflict, with President Donald Trump authorizing airstrikes and other military actions in Syria.

In 2017, President Trump authorized airstrikes against a Syrian airbase in response to a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government. In 2018, he ordered airstrikes against Syrian government targets in retaliation for another chemical weapons attack. In 2019, he ordered airstrikes against Iranian-backed forces in Syria.

The US has also increased its military presence in Syria, with US forces conducting operations against ISIS and other extremist groups. In addition, the US has provided financial and military support to the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led militia that is fighting ISIS in Syria.

## Reaction to US Involvement

The US involvement in the Syrian Civil War has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the US involvement argue that it is necessary to protect innocent civilians and to ensure that extremist groups, such as ISIS, do not gain a foothold in the region.

Critics of the US involvement argue that it could lead to an escalation of the conflict and could result in the US being dragged into a protracted and costly conflict. They also argue that US involvement in the conflict could lead to a further deterioration of US-Russia relations.
