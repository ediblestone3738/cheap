# What Day of the Week is the Best Time to Book a Flight?

Are you planning a trip and trying to find the best time to book a flight? It can be hard to know when to buy tickets to get the best deal. While airfare prices fluctuate based on when you book, midweek travel is likely cheaper than flying on weekends.

## Midweek Travel is Cheaper

According to Hopper data, "travelers who fly midweek, usually Wednesday, can save an average of $56 per ticket on domestic airfare throughout the year." This means that if you're looking to save money on your flight, it's best to book midweek.

## Booking in Advance is Cheaper

In addition to booking midweek, it's also important to book your flight in advance. According to Hopper, "the best time to book a domestic flight is usually between three weeks and four months in advance." This is because airlines tend to increase prices as the departure date approaches.

## Flexibility is Key

If you're looking for the best deal on a flight, it's important to be flexible. If you're willing to fly on different days of the week, or at different times of the day, you may be able to find a cheaper flight. It's also important to be flexible with your destination. If you're willing to fly to a different airport, or even a different city, you may be able to find a cheaper flight.

## Use Price Alerts

If you're looking for the best deal on a flight, it's important to keep an eye on prices. Many websites and apps offer price alerts, which will notify you when the price of a flight changes. This can help you find the best deal on a flight.

## Summary

When it comes to booking a flight, midweek travel is usually cheaper than flying on weekends. It's also important to book your flight in advance, and be flexible with your destination and departure time. Finally, it's important to use price alerts to make sure you're getting the best deal on a flight.

By following these tips, you can save money on your next flight and make sure you're getting the best deal. Happy travels!
