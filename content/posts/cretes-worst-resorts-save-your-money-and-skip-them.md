Crete is a beautiful and diverse island in Greece, boasting a rich history, stunning landscapes, and delicious cuisine. However, not all resorts on the island are created equal. In this article, we will be exploring Crete's worst resorts, highlighting why they should be avoided, and offering alternative options for a perfect holiday experience.

While there are many great resort destinations on Crete, there are also some that have earned a reputation for being subpar.
