# What are Free Hotels Called?

If you're a savvy traveler, you know that there are some amazing perks out there that can help you save money on your next trip. One of the best perks is getting a complimentary room, also known as a "comp" in the travel industry. A comp is a free hotel room that you can stay in for one or more nights, and it's a great way to save money on your next vacation.

## What is a Comp Room?

A comp room is a complimentary hotel room that is given to you for free. This type of room is usually given to travelers who are loyal customers of the hotel or have a special relationship with the hotel. Comp rooms are usually given out as a reward for loyalty or as a way to thank customers for their patronage.

## Who Can Get a Comp Room?

Comp rooms are typically given to customers who have a good relationship with the hotel. This could include customers who are frequent guests, have stayed at the hotel for a long period of time, or have a special relationship with the hotel staff.

In some cases, comp rooms may also be given to customers who are members of certain loyalty programs or have a special promotional code. These customers may be eligible for a free night or two at the hotel.

## How to Get a Comp Room

The best way to get a comp room is to be a loyal customer of the hotel. If you stay at the same hotel often, you may be eligible for a complimentary room. You can also ask the hotel staff if they have any comp rooms available.

If you're a member of a loyalty program, you may also be eligible for a comp room. Many loyalty programs offer special promotions or discounts that can help you save money on your stay.

## What Are the Benefits of a Comp Room?

The biggest benefit of a comp room is that it can save you money on your next trip. Comp rooms are typically free, so you don't have to worry about paying for a hotel room. This can help you save money on your next vacation.

Another benefit of a comp room is that it can make you feel special. Getting a free room is a great way to show your appreciation for the hotel and its staff. It's also a great way to show your loyalty to the hotel.

## What Are the Downsides of a Comp Room?

The biggest downside of a comp room is that it can be hard to get. Comp rooms are typically reserved for loyal customers or those with special relationships with the hotel. If you don't have a good relationship with the hotel, it can be difficult to get a comp room.

Another downside of a comp room is that it may not be available when you need it. Comp rooms are typically given out on a first-come, first-served basis, so if you don't get there early, you may not be able to get a comp room.

## Conclusion

Comp rooms are a great way to save money on your next trip. They are typically given to loyal customers or those with special relationships with the hotel. However, they can be hard to get and may not be available when you need them. If you're looking for a free hotel room, it's worth asking the hotel staff if they have any comp rooms available.
