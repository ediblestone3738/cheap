## How to make the most of your winter sun holiday

If you’re lucky enough to be jetting off to a winter sun destination this year, then you’ll want to make the most of your time in the sun. Here are our top tips for getting the most out of your winter sun holiday:

-Make sure you pack plenty of sunscreen and apply it regularly, even if you’re not spending much time in direct sunlight. The sun’s rays can be very strong, even when it’s not particularly hot, and you don’t want to come home with a nasty sunburn.

-Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. This is especially important if you’re drinking alcohol, as alcohol can dehydrate you very quickly.

-If you’re going to be spending time in the sea or swimming pool, make sure you take regular breaks out of the water to avoid getting too cold. It’s also a good idea to shower straight after swimming to avoid getting too cold when your body temperature starts to drop.

-Wear layers of clothing so that you can adjust your level of warmth depending on how hot or cold it is. It’s often cooler in the evenings than during the day, so a light jacket or cardigan can be useful for wearing in the evening.

-Try to get out and explore as much as possible – even if it’s just taking a walk along the beach or exploring the local area. Winter sun holidays are the perfect opportunity to relax, but there’s no need to spend all your time lounging by the pool!
