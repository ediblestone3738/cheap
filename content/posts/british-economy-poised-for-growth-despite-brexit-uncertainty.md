# British Economy Poised for Growth Despite Brexit Uncertainty

The United Kingdom is currently in the midst of a period of uncertainty due to the ongoing Brexit negotiations. Despite this, the British economy is still poised for growth in the coming year. This article will explore the current state of the UK economy and the potential for growth despite the Brexit uncertainty. It will also provide an overview of the top 10 tourist attractions located in the UK and a FAQ section answering some of the most commonly asked questions about the UK economy.

## Overview of the UK Economy

The UK economy is currently in a period of transition as the country prepares to leave the European Union. Despite this, the UK economy is still showing signs of growth. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the UK economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2019, which was an increase from the 0.3% growth seen in the previous quarter. This growth was driven by strong consumer spending and a resilient manufacturing sector.

The UK’s services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the UK’s GDP, also saw a 0.4% increase in the third quarter of 2019. This was driven by a strong performance in the financial and business services sector, which grew by 0.7%. The UK’s manufacturing sector also saw a 0.7% increase, driven by a strong performance in the automotive industry.

Despite this, the UK economy is still facing some headwinds due to the ongoing Brexit negotiations. The UK’s trade balance with the EU has been in deficit since 2017, which has weighed on the UK’s economic growth. In addition, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit has led to a slowdown in business investment.

## Potential for Growth

Despite the current uncertainty, the UK economy is still expected to grow in 2020. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast that the UK economy will grow by 1.4% in 2020, which is slightly lower than the 1.5% growth forecast in November 2019. This growth is expected to be driven by a recovery in business investment and an increase in consumer spending.

The OBR has also revised its forecast for the UK’s inflation rate, which is expected to remain low in 2020. This will help to keep consumer spending strong and provide a boost to the UK economy. The UK’s unemployment rate is also expected to remain low, which will help to support consumer spending.

## Top 10 Tourist Attractions in the UK

The UK is home to a variety of tourist attractions, ranging from historic sites to modern attractions. Here is a list of the top 10 tourist attractions located in the UK:

1\. The Tower of London
2\. Stonehenge
3\. The British Museum
4\. The Lake District
5\. The Cotswolds
6\. The Roman Baths
7\. Edinburgh Castle
8\. The Giant’s Causeway
9\. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
10\. The Peak District
