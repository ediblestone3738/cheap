Since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, various countries have taken different stances towards the conflict, and the United States is no exception. The US has been involved in the Syrian conflict in various ways, including military operations, political support for opposition groups, and diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution. This article will delve into the US's aggressive stance in the Syrian Civil War, the reasons behind it, and the implications for the war.

US's Aggressive Stance in Syrian Civil War

The US has been involved in the Syrian Civil War since the beginning of the conflict in 2011. Initially, the US provided non-lethal aid to opposition groups and supported diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. However, as the conflict escalated, the US increased its involvement by providing lethal aid and training to opposition groups.

In 2014, the US led an international coalition to fight against the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria. The coalition conducted airstrikes against the IS and supported Kurdish and Arab forces on the ground. In 2017, the US launched a missile strike against a Syrian airbase in response to a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government.

The US's aggressive stance in the Syrian Civil War is driven by several factors. Firstly, the US sees the conflict as a threat to its national security, as it has the potential to destabilize the wider region and create a safe haven for terrorists. Secondly, the US supports the Syrian opposition groups who are fighting against the Russian-backed Syrian government. The US sees the Syrian government as an ally of Iran, which it considers to be a threat to its interests in the Middle East. Thirdly, the US is committed to protecting the human rights of Syrians, who have suffered immensely as a result of the conflict.

Implications of US's Aggressive Stance

The US's aggressive stance in the Syrian Civil War has several implications for the conflict. Firstly, it signals to the Syrian government that the US is not willing to let it continue its brutal crackdown on opposition groups with impunity. Secondly, it gives hope to the Syrian opposition groups that they have a powerful ally who will support them in their struggle against the government. Thirdly, it sends a message to Russia and Iran that the US will not tolerate their support for the Syrian government and will take action if necessary.

However, the US's aggressive stance also has risks. Firstly, it could escalate the conflict and draw the US further into the war. Secondly, it could lead to a confrontation between the US and Russia, who are both militarily involved in the conflict. Thirdly, it could further undermine the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as the US's support for the opposition groups encourages them to continue fighting rather than negotiating.
