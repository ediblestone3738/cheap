# What Time of Day Are Hotel Prices Cheapest?

Are you looking for the best deals on hotel rooms? You may be surprised to learn that the time of day you book can make a big difference in the price you pay. According to hotel industry expert and travel blogger, Robert Shank, the best time to book a hotel room is in the late afternoon on the day of arrival.

## The Benefits of Late Afternoon Bookings

Throughout the day of check-in, prices keep decreasing,” says Shank. “If there are still these empty rooms by 4 p.m. the day of arrival, the hotel will have a lot of certainty that they are not going to get filled otherwise. That's when they're really willing to put a really, super good deal on it.”

Hotels are in the business of making money, so they are more likely to offer discounts on rooms that would otherwise remain empty. As the day of check-in approaches, the hotel has a better idea of how many rooms will remain unbooked. If there are still rooms available by 4 p.m., the hotel is more likely to offer a discount in order to fill them.

## The Downsides of Late Afternoon Bookings

While late afternoon bookings can be a great way to save money, there are some downsides to consider. The biggest downside is that you may not get the room you want. Hotels typically assign rooms on a first-come, first-served basis. If you wait until late in the day to book, you may not get the room type or location you were hoping for.

Another downside is that you may not get the best deal. Hotels are constantly changing their prices based on demand, so the price you see at 4 p.m. may not be the lowest price available. If you’re willing to take the risk, you may be able to find an even better deal if you wait a little longer.

## Tips for Finding the Best Deals

If you’re looking for the best deals on hotel rooms, here are a few tips to keep in mind:

- Book as early as possible. Hotels typically offer the best rates to those who book early.
- Check multiple websites. Different websites may offer different rates, so it pays to shop around.
- Be flexible with your dates. Prices can vary significantly depending on the day of the week.
- Sign up for loyalty programs. Many hotels offer discounts to members of their loyalty programs.
- Wait until late in the day. If you’re willing to take the risk, you may be able to find a great deal by waiting until late in the day.

## Conclusion

If you’re looking for the best deals on hotel rooms, the time of day you book can make a big difference. According to hotel industry expert and travel blogger, Robert Shank, the best time to book a hotel room is in the late afternoon on the day of arrival. Hotels are more likely to offer discounts on rooms that would otherwise remain empty, so waiting until late in the day can be a great way to save money. Just keep in mind that you may not get the room you want and the price you see may not be the lowest price available.
