# Is it Cheap to Book a Holiday the Day Before?

As a travel expert, I'm often asked if it's cheaper to book a holiday the day before. The answer is not a simple yes or no. It depends on a variety of factors, including the type of holiday you're looking for, the destination, and the time of year.

## Advantages of Booking in Advance

Booking in advance is often seen as the more expensive option, but it can also be the most cost-effective. When you book early, you can take advantage of early booking discounts, which can save you a lot of money. Additionally, you'll have more time to research and compare prices, which can help you find the best deal.

## Disadvantages of Booking in Advance

On the other hand, booking in advance can be risky. If you book too far in advance, you may not be able to take advantage of any last-minute deals that may come up. Additionally, you may be stuck with a higher price if the cost of the holiday goes down after you book.

## Advantages of Booking Last Minute

Booking last minute can be a great way to save money. Many tour operators and airlines offer discounts for last-minute bookings, so you may be able to get a great deal. Additionally, you won't have to worry about the cost of the holiday going down after you book.

## Disadvantages of Booking Last Minute

However, booking last minute can be risky. You may not be able to find the exact holiday you're looking for, as availability may be limited. Additionally, you may have to pay a premium for last-minute bookings, as tour operators and airlines may be able to charge more for last-minute bookings.

## Conclusion

Booking in advance is often seen as a more expensive option, however, like we said previously, if you can snap up those early booking deals, you may be able to get the price of your holiday down to the same bracket as when booking last minute. Ultimately, it depends on the type of holiday you're looking for, the destination, and the time of year. If you're flexible and willing to take a risk, you may be able to save money by booking last minute. However, if you're looking for a specific holiday, it may be best to book in advance to ensure you get the best deal.
