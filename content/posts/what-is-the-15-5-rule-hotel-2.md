# What is the 15/5 Rule Hotel?

The 15/5 Rule Hotel is a concept that has been adopted by many hotels and hospitality businesses to ensure that guests are given the best possible customer service. The 15/5 Rule states that when a guest is within 15 feet of a hotel employee, the employee should acknowledge the guest in some way, such as with a smile or a nod. Similarly, when a guest is within 5 feet of a hotel employee, the employee should greet the guest in an appropriate manner, such as with a “hello”, “good morning”, or “good evening”.

The 15/5 Rule Hotel concept was first introduced in April 2013 by the hospitality industry in an effort to improve customer service and create a more welcoming environment for guests. The concept is based on the idea that when a guest is acknowledged and greeted in a friendly manner, they are more likely to have a positive experience at the hotel.

## Why is the 15/5 Rule Important?

The 15/5 Rule is important because it helps to create a positive customer experience. By acknowledging and greeting guests in a friendly manner, hotel employees can make guests feel welcome and appreciated. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, which can ultimately result in more repeat business for the hotel.

In addition, the 15/5 Rule helps to create a professional and welcoming atmosphere for guests. By having hotel employees greet guests in a friendly manner, it can help to create a sense of comfort and security for guests. This can help to ensure that guests have a pleasant stay at the hotel and that they are more likely to recommend the hotel to their friends and family.

## How Can Hotels Implement the 15/5 Rule?

Hotels can implement the 15/5 Rule by training their employees on the concept and making sure that they understand the importance of acknowledging and greeting guests in a friendly manner. Hotels should also ensure that their employees are aware of the 15/5 Rule and that they are following it when interacting with guests.

In addition, hotels should ensure that their employees are properly trained on customer service and hospitality. This can help to ensure that employees are providing the best possible customer service and that they are creating a welcoming environment for guests.

## Conclusion

The 15/5 Rule Hotel is an important concept that can help to create a positive customer experience and ensure that guests are given the best possible customer service. By implementing the 15/5 Rule and properly training their employees on customer service and hospitality, hotels can create a welcoming environment for guests and ensure that they have a pleasant stay.
