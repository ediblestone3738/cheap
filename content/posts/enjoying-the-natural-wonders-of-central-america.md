There are many ways to explore the rainforests, from guided nature walks to birdwatching and zip lining above the treetops.

One of the most popular spots for rainforest adventures is Costa Rica, which is home to several national parks, including Manuel Antonio and Corcovado.

Central America is home to many active and dormant volcanoes, which form an incredible natural landscape. These towering peaks offer incredible opportunities for hiking, with stunning views from the summit and the chance to see lava flowing from the crater.

One of the most famous spots for beach lovers is the tiny island of Roatan off the coast of Honduras. Here, you can enjoy pristine white sands, crystal-clear waters, and world-class snorkeling and diving. Another great spot for beach lovers is Costa Rica's Manuel Antonio National Park, which boasts four stunning beaches surrounded by pristine rainforest.
