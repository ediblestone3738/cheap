# Ukraine Moves Closer to European Union Membership

Ukraine is a country located in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia, Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary.

In 2020, the European Commission proposed a visa-free regime for Ukrainians travelling to the EU. This would allow Ukrainians to travel to the EU without a visa for up to 90 days. This was a major step forward in the process of EU membership.
