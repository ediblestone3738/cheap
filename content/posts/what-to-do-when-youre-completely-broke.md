# What to do When You're Completely Broke?

Being broke can be a difficult and overwhelming experience. It can be hard to know where to start when you’re in this situation. But don’t panic! There are some things you can do to get back on your feet. Here are 8 crucial things to do when you’re broke.

## Don’t Panic

First things first, do not panic. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when you’re in a difficult financial situation, but it’s important to take a deep breath and focus on the steps you can take to get back on track.

## Make a Plan

Imagine you’re coaching a losing football team. What would you do? You’d make a plan. You’d look at the current situation, set goals, and create a strategy to reach those goals. The same applies to your finances. Take a look at your current situation, set some financial goals, and create a plan to reach those goals.

## Cut Expenses

Once you have a plan, it’s time to start cutting expenses. Take a look at your budget and see where you can make cuts. Do you really need that gym membership? Could you make your own coffee instead of buying it every day? Little changes can make a big difference.

## Bring in Extra Money

If you’re able to, look for ways to bring in extra money. You could take on a side job, sell some of your belongings, or even start a business.

## Make Use of Public Assistance

If you’re in a really tough spot, you may be eligible for public assistance. There are a variety of programs available, so do some research and see if you qualify.

## Ask for Help

It can be hard to ask for help, but it’s important to remember that you’re not alone. Reach out to family and friends and let them know what’s going on. They may be able to offer advice or even lend a helping hand.

## Talk to Your Creditors

If you’re having trouble making payments, reach out to your creditors. They may be willing to work with you and come up with a payment plan that works for both of you.

## Find Affordable Ways to Have Fun

It’s important to take a break and have some fun, even when you’re broke. Look for free or low-cost activities in your area. Go for a walk, have a picnic in the park, or invite friends over for a game night.

Being broke can be a difficult and overwhelming experience, but it doesn’t have to be. By following these 8 steps, you can get back on your feet and start feeling better about your finances.
