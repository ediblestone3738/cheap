# Do Motels Have Cameras in Rooms?

As a traveler, it's natural to worry about the safety and security of your accommodations. One of the most common worries is the possibility of being spied on in your hotel room. A recent study suggests that roughly 11% of travelers surveyed report finding a hidden camera in their Airbnb lodgings!

## Are Hotel Rooms Safe?

Luckily, security experts assure us that guests of trusted U.S. hotel chains have little to worry about. The majority of hotels have strict policies against installing cameras in guest rooms, and the few that do are required to post a sign notifying guests of the presence of cameras.

## What About Motels?

Motels, however, are a different story. While many motels are reputable and safe, some have been known to install cameras in their rooms without informing guests. In some cases, these cameras are installed to monitor guests and ensure they are following the motel's rules. In other cases, they are installed to monitor the activities of employees.

## How to Tell if There is a Camera in Your Room

If you are staying in a motel and are concerned about the possibility of cameras in your room, there are a few steps you can take to check. First, take a look around the room for any suspicious devices. If you see anything that looks like a camera, it's best to contact the motel's management and ask them to confirm whether or not it is a camera.

## What to Do if You Find a Camera in Your Room

If you do find a camera in your room, it's important to take action. First, contact the motel's management and ask them to remove the camera. If they refuse, you should contact the police and file a complaint. It's also a good idea to document the incident by taking pictures of the camera and its location in the room.

## Tips for Staying Safe in Motels

If you are staying in a motel, there are a few steps you can take to ensure your safety. First, make sure to read the motel's policies and rules before booking your stay. This will help you avoid any unpleasant surprises. Additionally, it's a good idea to inspect the room before you check in. Look for any suspicious devices or signs that cameras may be present.

## Conclusion

Motels can be a great option for travelers looking for a more affordable accommodation. However, it's important to be aware of the potential for cameras in motel rooms. If you are concerned about the possibility of cameras in your room, take the time to inspect the room before you check in and contact the motel's management if you find any suspicious devices.
