# Can You Ask a Hotel for a Lower Rate?

As a travel expert, I often get asked if it's possible to negotiate a lower rate at a hotel. The answer is yes, you can ask for a lower rate. Though it's best to phone ahead and try to negotiate a better rate before you arrive, you can also negotiate on arrival.

## Negotiating on the Phone

If you're calling a hotel to book a room, it's always worth asking if they have any special offers or discounts available. Many hotels offer discounts for AAA members, seniors, or members of the military. It's also worth asking if they have any last-minute deals or if they can match the rate of a competitor.

## Negotiating on Arrival

If you walk in without a reservation and are unhappy with the rate you are quoted, tell the desk clerk and ask if there is a lower rate or offer a rate that you are willing to pay. It's important to be polite and reasonable when negotiating a lower rate. If the hotel is full or the rate is non-negotiable, don't be afraid to ask if they can offer any other discounts or perks, such as free parking or breakfast.

## Tips for Negotiating a Lower Rate

Here are some tips for negotiating a lower rate at a hotel:

- Be polite and friendly when negotiating.
- Be flexible with your dates and consider staying mid-week.
- Be prepared to pay in cash if necessary.
- Ask for discounts or special offers.
- Be willing to walk away if the rate is non-negotiable.

## Conclusion

Negotiating a lower rate at a hotel is possible, but it's important to be polite and reasonable when doing so. It's best to phone ahead and try to negotiate a better rate before you arrive, but you can also negotiate on arrival. If the hotel is full or the rate is non-negotiable, don't be afraid to ask if they can offer any other discounts or perks.
