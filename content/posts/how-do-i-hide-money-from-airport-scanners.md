# How Do I Hide Money from Airport Scanners?

Airport security is getting tighter and tighter, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to hide money from airport scanners. With so many restrictions in place, it can be hard to know what’s allowed and what’s not.

The good news is that there are a few ways to get around airport scanners and hide your money. Here are some tips to help you keep your money safe and secure while traveling.

## 1\. Use a Money Belt

One of the best ways to hide money from airport scanners is to use a money belt. Money belts are small, lightweight pouches that can be worn around the waist or tucked into a pocket. They’re designed to be undetectable by airport scanners, and they can easily hold cash, credit cards, and other small items.

Money belts are also great for keeping your money safe from pickpockets. They’re made of strong materials and can be worn under your clothing, making them virtually impossible to detect.

## 2\. Put Money in Your Shoes

Another way to hide money from airport scanners is to put it in your shoes. Shoes are usually not scanned at airports, so you can easily tuck a few bills into the toe of your shoe and forget about it.

This method is especially useful if you’re traveling with a lot of cash. Just make sure to put the money in a secure place, such as a plastic bag or envelope, so it doesn’t get wet or damaged.

## 3\. Use a Wallet Insert

Wallet inserts are small pouches that can be inserted into your wallet. They’re designed to be undetectable by airport scanners, and they’re perfect for hiding cash and other small items.

Wallet inserts are great for keeping your money safe and secure. They’re also small enough to fit in your pocket, so you can easily access your money when you need it.

## 4\. Use a Hidden Pocket

Hidden pockets are small compartments that can be sewn into clothing. They’re designed to be undetectable by airport scanners, and they’re perfect for hiding cash and other small items.

Hidden pockets are great for keeping your money safe and secure. They’re also small enough to fit in your pocket, so you can easily access your money when you need it.

## 5\. Use a Travel Wallet

Travel wallets are small pouches that can be worn around the neck or tucked into a pocket. They’re designed to be undetectable by airport scanners, and they’re perfect for hiding cash and other small items.

Travel wallets are great for keeping your money safe and secure. They’re also small enough to fit in your pocket, so you can easily access your money when you need it.

## Conclusion

Hiding money from airport scanners can be tricky, but it’s not impossible. With a little bit of creativity and the right tools, you can keep your money safe and secure while traveling. Whether you use a money belt, wallet insert, hidden pocket, or travel wallet, you can rest assured that your money is safe and secure.
