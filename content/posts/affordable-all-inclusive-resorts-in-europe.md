# Affordable All Inclusive Resorts in Europe

Planning a holiday in Europe and wondering how to keep costs under control? One of the best ways to stretch your budget without sacrificing comfort is by staying at **affordable all inclusive resorts in Europe**. These resorts take the guesswork out of budgeting by covering your food, drinks, and even entertainment — and some of them offer luxury-level experiences at surprisingly low prices.

In this guide, we’ll explore what makes a European resort “affordable,” how to choose the right one for your needs, and highlight three excellent value-for-money resorts across the continent. Plus, we’ll help you answer a key question many travelers ask: [**Is it cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel?**](/uncategorized/is-it-cheaper-to-upgrade-to-all-inclusive-at-the-hotel/)

## Why Choose an All Inclusive Resort in Europe?

An all inclusive holiday gives you the peace of mind that your major expenses are already covered. You won’t need to worry about the fluctuating cost of meals, drinks, or daily entertainment — making it especially ideal for families, couples, or groups who want to relax rather than track every euro.

### Key Benefits:

- Meals, snacks, and drinks included

- On-site entertainment and activities

- Budget control with no hidden costs

- Stress-free travel experience

But **is all inclusive worth it in Europe** compared to self-catering or bed-and-breakfast? That depends on your destination and travel habits — which we’ll get into shortly.

## What Makes a Resort “Affordable” in Europe?

“Affordable” doesn’t always mean the cheapest. It means **value for money** — a resort that balances quality, amenities, and service at a price that won’t break your budget.

### Look for:

- High guest ratings (8+/10 on sites like Booking.com or Expedia)

- Competitive off-season or early-bird pricing

- Free upgrades or discounted kids’ stays

- Location close to beaches or attractions (to avoid costly taxis)

Many **cheap all inclusive beach resorts in Europe** are located in Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Eastern Europe, where your money tends to go further without sacrificing sunshine or service.

## Affordable All Inclusive Resorts in Europe: Top Picks

Here are three resorts that offer a fantastic all inclusive experience without the luxury price tag. Each destination also gives you the chance to explore beautiful surroundings and rich local culture.

### 1\. Iberostar Club Cala Barca – Mallorca, Spain

**Why It’s Affordable:** Despite being located in a prime beach area, this resort regularly offers packages under €100 per person per night, especially in the off-peak seasons (May/September).

**Highlights:**

- Set in a nature reserve with direct beach access

- Family-friendly with splash pool, playground, and activities

- Multiple restaurants and bars with varied cuisine

**Insider Tip:** Book a standard room and ask for a discounted upgrade upon arrival — staff often offer deals for longer stays or off-peak days. This is one of the places where it may be cheaper to **upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel**, especially if you only want it for a few days.

### 2\. Mitsis Rodos Village – Rhodes, Greece

**Why It’s Affordable:** Greece remains one of the most cost-effective destinations for resort holidays, and the Mitsis chain offers top-tier service at mid-range prices.

**Highlights:**

- Stunning location near Kiotari Beach

- Seven restaurants, including Greek, Asian, and Italian

- Day and evening entertainment included

**All Inclusive Upgrade Hack:** If you book room-only through a third-party site, you can often **upgrade to all inclusive at check-in** for much less than online. Check our [full guide here](/uncategorized/is-it-cheaper-to-upgrade-to-all-inclusive-at-the-hotel/) to see when this tactic saves the most money.

### 3\. Pestana Blue Alvor – Algarve, Portugal

**Why It’s Affordable:** Often available for under €120 per night, this 5-star resort is family-friendly and frequently offers seasonal promotions.

**Highlights:**

- Large modern rooms with balcony

- Kids club, multiple pools, and wellness spa

- All meals and drinks included, even cocktails

**Why It Stands Out:** Compared to other **all inclusive resorts in Europe with flights**, packages to the Algarve (especially from the UK or Ireland) are among the cheapest and best-connected.

## Is It Cheaper to Upgrade to All Inclusive at the Hotel?

Let’s tackle this common and important question:  
**Is it cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel, rather than booking it upfront?**

In many cases, yes.

### Based on Personal Experience:

We’ve tried both approaches — booking all inclusive in advance, and upgrading once at the resort. Often, hotels offer **in-resort upgrade discounts**, especially when:

- You’re staying for more than 3 nights

- The hotel is not fully booked

- You only want to upgrade for select days (like weekend stays)

The cost savings can be significant — **up to 30% cheaper** than online package rates. For more tips and a full breakdown, read our full article: [Is it Cheaper to Upgrade to All Inclusive at the Hotel?](/uncategorized/is-it-cheaper-to-upgrade-to-all-inclusive-at-the-hotel/)

## How to Find the Best Deals on Affordable All Inclusive Resorts in Europe

Booking a great all inclusive holiday doesn’t have to be complicated. Here are a few insider tips to help you score the best value:

### 1\. **Book Early or Very Late**

- Early bird deals (6+ months out) often include free nights or room upgrades.

- Last-minute deals can slash prices by 40% or more if you’re flexible.

### 2\. **Use Aggregators — But Check Direct**

Compare prices on Expedia, Booking.com, and OnTheBeach — then check the hotel’s own website. Sometimes direct booking includes perks like free transfers or spa access.

### 3\. **Travel Off-Peak**

The cheapest time to travel is May–June or September–October. You’ll avoid crowds and pay much less than high season (July–August).

### 4\. **Set Fare Alerts for Flight Packages**

Some **all inclusive resorts in Europe with flights** are bundled via travel agencies. Set alerts via [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights) or Skyscanner to monitor prices to top destinations like Rhodes, Mallorca, and Albufeira.

## Is All Inclusive Worth It in Europe?

So, how does an all inclusive resort compare to DIY-style travel?

### All Inclusive:

✅ Predictable costs  
✅ Relaxing and hassle-free  
✅ On-site dining and activities

### Independent Travel (Airbnb, Self-Catering):

✅ More flexibility  
✅ Ideal for city breaks  
✅ Often better for foodies or culture seekers

If you’re traveling with kids, want to stay near the beach, or simply need a stress-free break, **all inclusive is absolutely worth it in Europe** — especially when you find an affordable option.

Finding **affordable all inclusive resorts in Europe** is easier than ever, and you don’t have to sacrifice quality to stay within your budget. Whether you’re sipping sangria in Spain, watching the sunset in Greece, or exploring the Algarve coast, an all inclusive experience offers great value and convenience.

And remember — if you're unsure about committing upfront, you might get a better deal by choosing a base room and then [upgrading to all inclusive at the hotel](/uncategorized/is-it-cheaper-to-upgrade-to-all-inclusive-at-the-hotel/). It’s one of the smartest ways to enjoy luxury for less.

### Summary of Key Takeaways:

- All inclusive is ideal for families, couples, and stress-free getaways

- Iberostar Mallorca, Mitsis Rhodes, and Pestana Algarve are top value picks

- Upgrading in-resort can save up to 30%

- Travel off-season and compare deals for best prices
