# Do Flights Get Cheaper 2 Weeks Out?

As a travel expert, I often get asked the question, “Do flights get cheaper 2 weeks out?” The answer is not as straightforward as you might think. Generally speaking, plane tickets usually don't get cheaper closer to the departure date. Instead, flights tend to be the most inexpensive when you book between four months and three weeks before your departure date. According to CheapAir.com, you can expect rates to go up after that period.

## Why Don’t Flights Get Cheaper Closer to the Departure Date?

The reason why flights don’t get cheaper closer to the departure date is because airlines know that travelers are more likely to book a flight when the departure date is close. This is because travelers may have a last-minute emergency or may have forgotten to book a flight earlier. Therefore, airlines can charge more for last-minute tickets.

## When Should You Book a Flight?

The best time to book a flight is between four months and three weeks before your departure date. This is because airlines will be more likely to offer discounts and deals during this time period. Additionally, the earlier you book a flight, the more likely you are to get a better seat and a better price.

## How to Find Cheap Flights

Finding cheap flights can be a daunting task, but there are a few tips and tricks that can help you save money. First, it’s important to be flexible with your travel dates. This means that you should be willing to fly on different days of the week and at different times of the day. Additionally, you should be willing to fly to different airports. For example, if you’re flying to Los Angeles, you may be able to find a cheaper flight if you fly into Long Beach or Burbank instead of LAX.

Another way to save money on flights is to use a flight search engine. Flight search engines allow you to compare prices from different airlines and airports. This can help you find the best deals and save money. Additionally, many flight search engines offer price alerts, which can help you stay up to date on the latest deals and discounts.

Finally, it’s important to be aware of airline sales and promotions. Airlines often offer discounts and deals on flights, so it’s important to keep an eye out for these. Additionally, many airlines offer loyalty programs, which can help you save money on flights.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, flights don’t usually get cheaper closer to the departure date. Instead, the best time to book a flight is between four months and three weeks before your departure date. Additionally, there are a few tips and tricks that can help you save money on flights, such as being flexible with your travel dates, using a flight search engine, and being aware of airline sales and promotions.
