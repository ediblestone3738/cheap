# What Days to Book Off in 2023?

As we enter a new year, it’s important to plan ahead and consider what days you should book off in 2023. Taking time off is essential for our mental and physical wellbeing, and can help us stay productive and motivated throughout the year.

Fortunately, the UK government has already announced the dates of the bank holidays for 2023. This includes the traditional public holidays such as New Year’s Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, and Boxing Day, as well as the additional bank holidays for the spring and summer.

## New Year’s Day

The first bank holiday of the year is New Year’s Day, which falls on Monday, January 2nd, 2023. This is a substitute day for the traditional New Year’s Day holiday, which falls on a Sunday. This is a great opportunity to kick off the year with a relaxing break and spend time with family and friends.

## Good Friday

The next bank holiday is Good Friday, which falls on Friday, April 7th, 2023. This is a Christian holiday that marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and is typically celebrated with religious services and family gatherings.

## Easter Monday

The following Monday, April 10th, 2023, is Easter Monday. This is a public holiday that marks the end of the Easter weekend and is typically celebrated with Easter egg hunts and other festivities.

## Early May Bank Holiday

The Early May Bank Holiday falls on Monday, May 1st, 2023. This is a public holiday that celebrates the coming of spring and is typically celebrated with outdoor activities such as picnics and barbecues.

## Spring Bank Holiday

## Boxing Day

The last bank holiday of the year is Boxing Day, which falls on Tuesday, December 26th, 2023. This is a public holiday that celebrates the Christmas season and is typically celebrated with family gatherings and gift exchanges.

## 4 Sept 2022

In addition to the bank holidays, the UK government has also announced a special bank holiday for 4 Sept 2022. This is a one-off bank holiday to mark the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and is a great opportunity to celebrate the Queen’s 70 years on the throne.

## Conclusion

By planning ahead and booking off the bank holidays in 2023, you can make sure that you get the most out of your year. Taking time off is essential for our mental and physical wellbeing, and can help us stay productive and motivated throughout the year.

So, make sure to mark the dates of the bank holidays in your calendar and start planning your days off for 2023!
