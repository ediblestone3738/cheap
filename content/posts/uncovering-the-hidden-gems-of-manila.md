Uncovering the Hidden Gems of Manila

Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, is a picturesque city with a rich cultural heritage. Known for its historical landmarks, stunning architecture, and bustling streets, Manila has a lot to offer to tourists. However, the city's hidden gems are often overlooked despite their immense value. This article is an attempt to uncover some of these hidden gems and bring them to the forefront.

Exploring Manila's Hidden Gems

1\. Escolta Street

Escolta Street is one of Manila's oldest streets, dating back to the Spanish Colonial era. It was once the city's premier commercial district, and many of its buildings still bear the marks of its former glory. Walk around the area and take in the architecture, which includes Art Deco and Neo-Classical designs. Some of the notable landmarks in the area include the Capitol Theater and Regina Building.

2\. Quiapo Church

Quiapo Church is not exactly hidden, as it draws in hordes of devotees every year for the annual Feast of the Black Nazarene. However, outside of the grand event, the church is relatively quiet and serene. The church has a fascinating history and is home to some of the country's most significant religious relics, including the miraculous image of Our Lady of Quiapo.

3\. Hapag Filipino

Located along West Avenue, Hapag Filipino is a restaurant that's worth a visit for its unique blend of traditional and modern Filipino cuisine. The menu ranges from classic dishes such as adobo to more adventurous ones like kalderetang baka (beef stew) with bone marrow. The restaurant has an inviting atmosphere, with warm lighting, brick walls, and wooden floors.

4\. San Sebastian Church

San Sebastian Church is an impressive neo-Gothic structure, one of the few of its kind in the country. The church is made entirely of steel and is the only all-metal church in the Philippines. It's also the only pre-fabricated steel church in the world. Its intricate designs and stained-glass windows are a treat for the eyes and the soul.

5\. Paco Park

Paco Park is a tranquil oasis in the heart of bustling Manila. It was originally a cemetery during the Spanish Colonial period but was later converted into a park. It's a popular spot for picnics, weddings, and music events. The park has a serene ambiance with its lush greenery and charming chapel, making it the perfect place to take a breather from the chaos of city life.

6\. Bahay Tsinoy Museum

Bahay Tsinoy Museum is a cultural museum that aims to preserve and promote the history of the Chinese in the Philippines. The museum's exhibits showcase the Chinese influence on Filipino history and culture, from the early period to modern times. The museum is housed in a beautiful heritage building in Intramuros, and its location alone is worth a visit.

7\. Chinatown

Manila's Chinatown, also known as Binondo, is one of the oldest and largest Chinatowns in the world. It's a vibrant area with a unique character that's distinct from the rest of Manila. The streets are lined with shops selling traditional Chinese goods, and the restaurants serve authentic Chinese cuisine. A visit to Chinatown is a chance to immerse yourself in a different culture just a few blocks away from the heart of Manila.

8\. The Mind Museum

The Mind Museum is a world-class science museum that aims to make science accessible and fun for everyone. The museum has interactive exhibits that cover a wide range of scientific disciplines, from biology to physics to astronomy. It's a great place to bring kids or anyone who's curious about the world around us. The museum is located in Bonifacio Global City, a thriving business and lifestyle hub in Manila.

9\. Pinto Art Museum

Pinto Art Museum is a contemporary art museum located in Antipolo City, about an hour's drive from Manila. The museum showcases a collection of modern and contemporary art from some of the country's most celebrated artists. The museum's structures and garden are also works of art, making for an immersive experience.

10\. Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar

Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar is a unique resort that aims to preserve the country's colonial-era architecture. The resort is a sprawling property filled with beautiful heritage houses, complete with cobbled streets and a beautiful river. The houses were transported from different locations around the country and rebuilt on the property to form a beautiful living museum.
