# What are Motels Used For?

Motels, also known as Motor Lodges, Motor Courts, Tourist Courts, or Motor Inns, are a type of hotel that are designed for people travelling by car. They provide convenient parking spaces for guests, making them a great choice for those who are on the road. Motels are popular with business travellers, convention and meeting attendees, vacationers, and tourists alike.

## The Benefits of Staying in a Motel

Motels offer a range of benefits for travellers. Firstly, they are often located close to highways and other major roads, making them convenient for those who are travelling by car. This is especially useful for those who are travelling long distances, as they can easily stop off at a motel for the night.

Motels are also generally cheaper than other types of accommodation, making them a great choice for those who are on a budget. This is especially true for those who are travelling with a group, as they can often get a discount for booking multiple rooms.

## The Different Types of Motels

Motels come in a range of different styles and sizes. Some are large and luxurious, while others are more basic and affordable. The type of motel you choose will depend on your budget and needs.

The most basic type of motel is the budget motel. These are usually smaller and more basic than other types of motels, but they are often the cheapest option. They are ideal for those who are travelling on a tight budget and don’t need any extra amenities.

The next step up is the mid-range motel. These are usually larger and more comfortable than budget motels, and they often offer additional amenities such as a swimming pool or a restaurant. They are a great choice for those who want a bit more comfort and convenience.

Finally, there are luxury motels. These are the most expensive type of motel, but they offer the most luxurious amenities. They are perfect for those who want to experience the highest level of comfort and convenience while travelling.

## What to Look for When Choosing a Motel

When choosing a motel, there are a few things you should consider. Firstly, you should look at the location. Make sure that the motel is close to the places you want to visit, and that it is easy to get to from the highway.

You should also consider the amenities that the motel offers. If you are travelling with a group, you may want to look for a motel that offers a discount for multiple rooms. You should also check to see if the motel has a swimming pool, a restaurant, or other amenities that you may need.

Finally, you should consider the price. Motels can vary greatly in price, so make sure you compare prices before booking. This will help you get the best deal possible.

## Conclusion

Motels are a great choice for those who are travelling by car. They are often located close to highways and other major roads, making them convenient for those who are travelling long distances. They are also generally cheaper than other types of accommodation, making them a great choice for those who are on a budget. When choosing a motel, make sure to consider the location, amenities, and price before booking.

By following these tips, you can ensure that you get the best deal possible when booking a motel. With the right motel, you can have a comfortable and convenient stay while travelling.
