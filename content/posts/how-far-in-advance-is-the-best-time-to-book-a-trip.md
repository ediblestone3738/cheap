# How Far in Advance is the Best Time to Book a Trip?

When it comes to planning a trip, the question of when to book can be a tricky one. With the cost of airfare, hotels, and other travel expenses rising, it’s important to get the timing right. Fortunately, there are some general guidelines that can help you determine the best time to book a trip.

## Domestic Travel

According to travel expert Brian Berg, the best time to book a domestic trip is three to four months in advance. This gives you enough time to compare prices and find the best deals. It’s also recommended to book one to two months ahead of travel, as airfare tends to rise rapidly in the last three to four weeks before takeoff.

## International Travel

When it comes to international travel, the best time to book is typically six to eight months in advance. This gives you enough time to research the best deals and compare prices. It’s also important to consider the time of year you’re traveling, as airfare can be more expensive during peak travel times.

## Last-Minute Travel

If you’re looking to book a last-minute trip, you may be able to find some good deals. Airlines often offer discounts on flights that are leaving soon, so it’s worth checking to see if there are any available. You can also check for last-minute hotel deals, as some hotels may offer discounts for last-minute bookings.

## Other Considerations

When booking a trip, it’s important to consider other factors such as your budget, the type of trip you’re taking, and the destination. For example, if you’re planning a budget trip, you may want to book further in advance to take advantage of cheaper airfare and hotel rates. If you’re planning a luxury trip, you may want to book closer to the departure date to get the best deals.

## Conclusion

When it comes to booking a trip, the best time to do so depends on a variety of factors. For domestic travel, it’s recommended to book three to four months in advance, while international travel should be booked six to eight months in advance. Last-minute travel can also be a great option, as airlines and hotels often offer discounts on flights and rooms that are leaving soon. Ultimately, the best time to book a trip is the time that works best for you and your budget.
