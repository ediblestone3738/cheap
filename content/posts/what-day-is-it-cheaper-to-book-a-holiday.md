# What Day is it Cheaper to Book a Holiday?

Planning a holiday can be an exciting time, but it can also be stressful when it comes to budgeting. One of the biggest expenses of any holiday is the cost of booking flights and accommodation. But did you know that the day you book your holiday can make a difference to the price you pay?

## The Best Day to Book a Holiday

Research has shown that the best day to book a holiday is on a Wednesday. This is because many airlines and travel companies launch their deals and discounts on a Tuesday, and by Wednesday, they have had time to assess the demand and adjust their prices accordingly. This means that you can often get the best prices on a Wednesday.

## International Holidaymakers

International holidaymakers can also save 5% by booking on a Wednesday, instead of Saturday, the priciest day to book. This is because many airlines and travel companies offer special discounts for international customers, and these discounts are usually available on a Wednesday.

## When Not to Book a Holiday

The worst day to book a holiday is on a Saturday. This is because most airlines and travel companies are closed on the weekends, so they are unable to adjust their prices to reflect the demand. This means that you are likely to pay more for your holiday if you book on a Saturday.

## The Best Time to Book a Holiday

The best time to book a holiday is at least three months in advance. This is because most airlines and travel companies offer discounts for early bookings, so you can save money by booking your holiday early.

## Example

For example, if you were planning a holiday for 16 March 2022, you would be best off booking your flights and accommodation on a Wednesday at least three months in advance. This would give you the best chance of getting the best prices and discounts.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the best day to book a holiday is on a Wednesday, and the best time to book a holiday is at least three months in advance. International holidaymakers can also save 5% by booking on a Wednesday, instead of Saturday, the priciest day to book. By following these tips, you can save money on your holiday and have more money to spend on other things.
