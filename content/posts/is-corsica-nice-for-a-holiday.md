Is Corsica Nice for a Holiday?

Corsica, an island nestled between the French mainland and Italy, is an absolute paradise for travelers. Known for its stunning landscapes, crystal-clear waters, and timeless villages, Corsica offers a unique blend of natural beauty and cultural heritage. With a diverse range of activities and destinations, Corsica is definitely worth considering for your next holiday. So, is Corsica nice for a holiday? Let’s find out.

Getting There

Corsica is accessible by air, with flights from major European cities such as London, Paris, and Rome. Most flights arrive at the island's capital Ajaccio or the port city of Bastia. Alternatively, visitors can also reach the island via ferry, with regular services from France and Italy. Once on the island, renting a car is highly recommended as public transport is limited, and having your own vehicle allows you to explore the island at your own pace.

Where to Stay

Corsica has a variety of accommodation options, ranging from budget to luxury. The island also boasts a unique form of accommodation, ‘Gîtes de France’, which are cozy country cottages that provide a great opportunity to experience the island's rural life. The main tourist hubs include Porto Vecchio, Bonifacio, Calvi, and Ajaccio. Each of these towns offers a unique experience, such as Bonifacio's historic citadel, Calvi's sandy beaches, and Porto Vecchio's vibrant nightlife.

What to Do

Corsica has something to offer for everyone, from hiking enthusiasts to water sports enthusiasts. The island is home to several hiking trails, including the famous GR20, which is one of Europe's toughest long-distance hikes. The path stretches 180km from Calenzana in the north to Conca in the south, with a total elevation gain of 13,000m. The stunning views of the island's rugged terrain make the challenge worthwhile.

For beach lovers, Corsica's 1,000km coastline boasts some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe. The island's southern coast has several secluded beaches such as Roccapina and Palombaggia, while the northern coast has long sandy beaches such as Saleccia and Loto. The crystal-clear waters of Corsica's beaches are perfect for snorkeling, diving, and other water sports.

Culture enthusiasts will appreciate Corsica's rich history and culture. The island has a strong nationalist identity, and the locals are proud of their unique language and traditions. Visitors can explore Corsica's historic towns, such as Calvi, with its citadel and stunning views over the sea. The town of Bonifacio, perched on a white chalk cliff, is also worth a visit, with its impressive citadel and medieval houses.

FAQs

Q: Do I need a car in Corsica?

A: Although public transport is available, renting a car is highly recommended as it allows you to explore the island at your own pace and access remote areas.

Q: What is the best time to visit Corsica?

A: The best time to visit Corsica is between May and September when the weather is warm and sunny. However, July and August can be crowded, so consider traveling in June or September for lower prices and fewer crowds.

A: Corsican is the island’s native language, but French is also widely spoken, and English is spoken in tourist areas.
