# Why is TUI in Trouble?

TUI, one of the world’s leading holiday groups, has recently revealed a £63 million hit from the recent travel chaos that crippled airports and led to flight cancellations and lengthy delays. The firm said its customers were affected by about 200 cancelled flights in May and June, mainly relating to departures from Manchester Airport amid staff shortages.

The travel chaos has had a huge impact on TUI’s finances, and the company is now in trouble. In this blog post, we’ll take a look at why TUI is in trouble and what the company is doing to try and get back on track.

## The Impact of the Travel Chaos

The travel chaos has had a huge impact on TUI’s finances. The company has had to cancel flights, refund customers, and pay out compensation. This has all had a significant impact on the company’s bottom line.

In addition, the travel chaos has had a knock-on effect on the company’s other businesses. For example, the company’s cruise business has been affected by the disruption, as customers have been put off booking cruises due to the uncertainty.

## The Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic

The coronavirus pandemic has also had a huge impact on TUI’s finances. The company has had to cancel flights and holidays due to the pandemic, and has had to refund customers. This has had a huge impact on the company’s bottom line.

In addition, the pandemic has had a knock-on effect on the company’s other businesses. For example, the company’s cruise business has been affected by the pandemic, as customers have been put off booking cruises due to the uncertainty.

## The Impact of Brexit

Brexit has also had an impact on TUI’s finances. The company has had to cancel flights and holidays due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, and has had to refund customers. This has had a huge impact on the company’s bottom line.

In addition, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit has had a knock-on effect on the company’s other businesses. For example, the company’s cruise business has been affected by the uncertainty, as customers have been put off booking cruises due to the uncertainty.

## What is TUI Doing to Get Back on Track?

TUI is taking a number of steps to try and get back on track. The company is focusing on cost-cutting measures, such as reducing staff numbers and cutting back on marketing and advertising.

In addition, the company is looking to diversify its business. For example, the company is looking to expand its cruise business, as well as its hotel and resort business.

The company is also looking to expand into new markets, such as Asia and Latin America. This will help the company to diversify its business and reduce its reliance on the UK and European markets.

## Conclusion

TUI is in trouble due to the recent travel chaos, the coronavirus pandemic, and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. The company is taking a number of steps to try and get back on track, such as cost-cutting measures, diversifying its business, and expanding into new markets.

Only time will tell if these measures will be enough to get the company back on track, but it’s clear that TUI is facing a difficult period.
