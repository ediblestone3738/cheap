# Visit Stonehenge in the UK

## The Mystique of Stonehenge

When I first laid eyes on Stonehenge, I was utterly captivated. This megalithic structure, standing tall against the backdrop of the English countryside, holds a sense of mystery that beckons travelers from all over the world. As one of the most famous landmarks in the UK, Stonehenge is not just an archaeological wonder but a place steeped in history and mythology. In this article, I’ll share my experience visiting this iconic site, along with practical tips to make your journey memorable.

## A Brief History of Stonehenge

Stonehenge dates back to around 3000 BC, making it over 5,000 years old! This prehistoric monument was built in several stages, with the large sarsen stones and smaller bluestones carefully positioned to create a circular pattern. The purpose of Stonehenge remains a topic of debate among historians and archaeologists. Some believe it was a burial ground, while others argue it served as an astronomical observatory or a place for rituals. Whatever its true purpose, standing among those ancient stones is a humbling experience.

### Planning Your Visit

Before you embark on your journey to Stonehenge, here are some practical tips to help you make the most of your visit:

#### 1\. Getting There

Stonehenge is located about 8 miles north of Salisbury, in Wiltshire, England. The easiest way to reach it is by car, as it’s well signposted from major nearby towns. If you're using public transport, you can take a train to Salisbury, followed by a local bus service that frequently runs to Stonehenge.

#### 2\. Tickets and Entry

Tickets can be purchased online, which I highly recommend to avoid long queues. The standard adult ticket is around £19.50, and children under 5 can enter for free. It’s worth noting that the site gets busier during peak tourist season (May to September), so try to visit early in the morning or later in the afternoon for a more peaceful experience.

#### 3\. Opening Hours

Stonehenge is open all year round, but the hours vary depending on the season. Generally, the site opens at 9:00 AM and closes between 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM, depending on the time of year. Always check the official website for the most current information before your visit.

## What to Expect on Your Visit

Upon arriving at Stonehenge, the first thing that struck me was the sheer size of the stones—standing over 13 feet tall and weighing around 25 tons! The visitor center offers a wealth of information about the history and significance of the site, including interactive displays and artifacts that enhance your understanding of this ancient monument.

### Exploring the Stones

As you approach the stones, you’ll notice the well-maintained pathways that guide you around the monument. While you can’t touch the stones (to preserve their integrity), you can take plenty of photos from designated areas. I spent time just soaking in the atmosphere, listening to the wind rustle through the grass and watching the clouds drift by. It's easy to lose track of time in such a tranquil setting.

### Audio Guides

If you're keen to learn more about Stonehenge during your visit, consider renting an audio guide. It provides fascinating insights and stories that you might otherwise miss. I found it enhanced my experience, making the ancient site come alive with tales of its history and purpose.

## Nearby Attractions

After exploring Stonehenge, don’t miss the chance to visit nearby attractions. Here are some favorites:

### 1\. Avebury Stone Circle

Just a short drive from Stonehenge, the Avebury Stone Circle is another remarkable prehistoric site. Unlike Stonehenge, you can walk among the stones here, making it a more immersive experience. The village of Avebury is charming, and you can even enjoy a lovely lunch at one of the local pubs.

### 2\. Old Sarum

Located just outside Salisbury, Old Sarum is an ancient hill fort that offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. It’s a great spot to delve into more of England’s rich history, with remnants of a castle and a cathedral that once stood there.

### 3\. Salisbury Cathedral

No trip to this area would be complete without visiting Salisbury Cathedral. Home to the tallest spire in the UK and an original copy of the Magna Carta, this stunning cathedral is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture. Be sure to take a moment to appreciate the serene beauty of the surrounding grounds.

## Final Thoughts

Visiting Stonehenge was a highlight of my travels in the UK. The combination of history, mystery, and natural beauty is truly captivating. Whether you're a history buff, a photography enthusiast, or simply someone who appreciates the wonders of the world, Stonehenge promises an unforgettable experience.

Take your time, soak in the atmosphere, and let your imagination wander as you stand among the stones that have stood for millennia. No matter how you choose to explore this iconic site, it's sure to leave a lasting impression. Happy travels!
