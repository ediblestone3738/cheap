Join us as we explore the allure of Croatia’s sailing routes, islands, and culinary delights, making it the perfect destination for your next adventure.



## Your Voyage Begins: Popular Sailing Routes



Croatia is renowned for its spectacular coastline, featuring over a thousand islands scattered across its Adriatic waters. One of the most popular sailing routes is from **Split to Dubrovnik**, a journey that reveals both historical charm and stunning scenery.



### Split to Dubrovnik



This route stretches over 200 nautical miles, with opportunities to stop at various picturesque spots along the way. Start your journey in the vibrant town of **Split**, where the ancient Roman architecture of Diocletian's Palace meets modern life. From Split, sail to the enchanting island of **Hvar** known for its lively nightlife and aromatic lavender fields.



As you continue your voyage, make a stop at **Vis**, famous for its pristine beaches and crystal-clear waters. You can enjoy lunch at one of the local konobas (taverns) serving fresh seafood. Afterward, head to **Korčula**, the reputed birthplace of Marco Polo, where you can stroll through its enchanting medieval streets.



Finally, immerse yourself in the history of **Dubrovnik**, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Pearl of the Adriatic." The iconic city walls and stunning architecture will leave you inspired, marking a memorable end to your sailing journey.



## Explore Charming Island Towns



Croatia's islands offer more than just beauty; each town tells a story that is woven into its culture and traditions. Here are a few must-visit islands and towns during your sailing holiday:



### Hvar



Known for its energetic atmosphere, Hvar is a sunny island favored by yacht enthusiasts and party-goers alike. Explore its quaint streets filled with historic architecture and indulge in mouthwatering local delicacies paired with a glass of PLAVAC MALI, a delicious red wine that embodies the essence of Dalmatian terroir.



### Vis



The island of Vis boasts beautiful secluded beaches and stunning vineyards. It was once a military base, which kept it off the tourist radar until recently, preserving its charm. Try **peka**, a Croatian dish made with meats or seafood and vegetables slow-cooked under a bell-shaped lid, for an authentic culinary experience.
