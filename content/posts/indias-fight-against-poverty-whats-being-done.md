India's Fight Against Poverty: What's Being Done?

India is known for its rich culture, heritage and diversity, but it's also known for its high poverty rate. In a country of 1.3 billion people, more than 364 million Indians live below the poverty line. However, India is taking strides to alleviate poverty and work towards an inclusive economy.

Impact of Poverty in India:

Poverty in India affects a vast number of people, especially in rural areas. It's an issue that needs to be addressed due to its impact on health, education, and employment opportunities. One of the significant effects of poverty is malnutrition. According to the World Bank, about 25% of Indian children under five are undernourished, which is the highest in the world. Poverty also leads to an inadequate education system, which perpetuates the cycle of poverty. Lack of education leads to low-paying jobs, which, in turn, keeps them in poverty. Inequality, gender discrimination and lack of access to healthcare are other issues faced by the poor in India.

6\. Digital India: It is an ambitious programme of the Government of India with an aim to transform India into a digital economy.

7\. Make in India: The programme aims to encourage domestic manufacturing in India to increase employment opportunities and reduce dependency on imported goods.

8\. National Food Security Act: The act aims to provide legal entitlements to the people in India for subsidised food grains.

9\. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act: MGNREGA is a scheme for rural employment generation. It guarantees 100 days of wage employment per year to every rural household.
