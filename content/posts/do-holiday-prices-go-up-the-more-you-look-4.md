# Do Holiday Prices Go Up the More You Look?

Are you worried that your holiday browsing is causing prices to go up? It's a common concern, but recent data suggests that this isn't the case. In this blog post, we'll explore the idea of holiday prices going up the more you look, and what the evidence says.

## The Theory Behind Price Increases

The idea that holiday prices go up the more you look is based on the theory of dynamic pricing. This is a pricing strategy used by companies to increase prices based on demand. For example, if a flight is in high demand, the price will go up to reflect this.

The theory behind dynamic pricing is that the more you look at a particular holiday, the more the company will assume you want it, and the higher the price will go. This means that if you keep looking at the same holiday, the price will keep increasing.

## Does the Theory Hold Up?

Recent data suggests that the theory of dynamic pricing doesn't hold up when it comes to holiday prices. A study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, found that the prices of flights and hotels did not increase when people looked at them multiple times.

The study also found that the prices of flights and hotels were not affected by the number of times a person looked at them. This suggests that the prices of holidays do not go up the more you look.

## What Else Can Affect Prices?

Although the theory of dynamic pricing doesn't hold up when it comes to holiday prices, there are other factors that can affect the cost of a holiday. For example, the time of year you travel can have an impact on the price. During peak season, prices are usually higher than during off-peak times.

The type of holiday you choose can also affect the price. For example, if you choose an all-inclusive holiday, the cost will usually be higher than if you choose a self-catering holiday.

## Tips for Finding the Best Price

If you're looking for the best price for your holiday, there are a few things you can do. Firstly, try to book your holiday as far in advance as possible. Prices tend to go up the closer you get to the date of travel, so booking early can help you save money.

It's also a good idea to compare prices from different companies. Different companies may offer different prices for the same holiday, so it's worth shopping around to find the best deal.

Finally, make sure to check for any discounts or special offers. Many companies offer discounts for certain types of holidays, or for booking multiple holidays at once.

## Conclusion

The theory that holiday prices go up the more you look is not supported by recent data. Prices are not affected by the number of times a person looks at them, and there are other factors that can affect the cost of a holiday.

If you're looking for the best price for your holiday, it's a good idea to book as far in advance as possible, compare prices from different companies, and look out for any discounts or special offers.

Happy travels!
