## How to save money on your European holiday

Europe is a hugely popular destination for tourists from all over the world, but it can also be one of the most expensive places to travel. If you’re looking for ways to save money on your European holiday, here are 10 top tips:

1\. **Travel in shoulder season** – This is the time between the end of summer and the start of winter, when temperatures are cooler and there are fewer tourists. This can also be a great time to find cheaper accommodation and flight prices.

2\. **Fly into smaller airports** – Major airports are usually located close to major cities, so they can be more expensive to fly into. If you’re flexible with your travel plans, consider flying into a smaller airport that’s located further away from your final destination. You may be able to find cheaper flights this way.

3\. **Stay in hostels or Airbnbs** – Hostels are a great way to meet other travelers and save money on accommodation costs. Airbnbs can also be a cheaper alternative to hotels, especially if you’re traveling in a group or family.

4\. **Avoid tourist traps** – Tourist traps are usually crowded places that charge higher prices for food, drinks, and souvenirs. If you want to save money, avoid these areas and look for hidden gems instead.

5\. **Eat like a local** – Eating out in restaurants can be expensive, so try to eat like a local by buying food from supermarkets or markets. This will help you save money and also allow you to try some traditional dishes.

6 **Take advantage of free activities** – There are often plenty of free activities available in European cities, such as walking tours, museum visits, and concerts in parks or squares. Do some research before you leave so you can plan your itinerary around these free activities.

7 **Use public transportation** – Public transportation is usually cheaper than taking taxis or renting cars . In some cities , such as London , Paris , and Berlin , there are also day passes available that offer unlimited travel on buses , trains , and subways . This can be a great way to save money if you plan on doing a lot of sightseeing . In addition tokens for public transportation systems can often be bought at discount if bulk purchased ahead of time from kiosks at central subway stations . Be aware that this will require some upfront investment but if carefully planned could result in significant savings . Assess whether it make sense purchase these tokens ahead of time by determining how often you anticipate using public transportation during your stay as well as how much each ride would cost without the discount . For infrequent users or those only staying for a short period it might not make sense while heavy users or those staying longer could see greater savings . Another tactics is see if your hotel offers any discounts or complimentary tickets for public transportation systems as part of their guest perks Many times they will! Even if they don't Ask ! It never hurts to inquire Because even if they don't offer anything directly they may be ableto provide helpful tips such as directions on where closest station is located etcetera which could save time wasted getting lost Additionally consider looking online before your trip for any coupons or deals that might be available from vendors such as Viator Make sure however that vendor is reputable so read reviews online prior selecting one Verify what type of customer service they offer as well should situation arise where voucher wasn't accepted etcetera Also keep mind many companies scale up their operations during peak tourist season so Book early when possible this way selection will still be good but at least some vendors might offer early bird specials which could help offset cost And finally Some attractions offer special pricing at off-peak hours typically mid-morning weekday mornings Check schedules see what's feasible based on planned itinerary If schedule allows it might make sense visit popular attractions during these times wait until later tour more obscure places which typically have shorter lines anyway To recap common ways help reduce costs while vacationing in Europe include : 1 ) Traveling during shoulder season 2 ) Flying into smaller airports 3 ) Staying hostels or Use Airbnbs 4) Eating like Local 5) Taking advantage of Free Activities 6) Utilize public transportation 7) Look online deals / coupons
