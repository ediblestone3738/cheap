## Best Time to Visit Vietnam

Vietnam is a popular tourist destination due to its diverse geography, culture, and cuisine. To get the most out of any visit, it’s important to plan your trip during the best time of year. The climate varies widely by region. Northern Vietnam tends to be hot and humid while southern Vietnam is generally cooler and drier. Generally speaking, the best time to visit is during the dry season from November to April.

This period typically has less rain and more pleasant temperatures ranging from 20-25 degrees Celsius (68-77 Fahrenheit). Avoiding the rainy season will also reduce your risk of experiencing extreme weather conditions such as flooding or hurricanes which can occur from May–October, especially in Central and Southern Vietnam.

Fall tends to be a popular time for visitors who are looking for a pleasant combination of warm temperatures and fewer tourists than during peak season months (January–March). Regardless of when you choose to visit, travelers should always find out current weather forecasts before they arrive in Vietnam so they are prepared for any climate related surprises!

## Accommodation Options in Vietnam

When it comes to accommodation options in Vietnam, there is something for every budget and taste. If you’re looking for a little luxury, you can stay at a five-star hotel or resort; almost all of the major cities have these available and they can be quite opulent.

If you're looking to save some money, there are also mid-range hotels as well as hostels for backpackers and budget travelers. One popular option is homestays — where you can stay with a local family in their home. This is a great way to get an insider’s perspective while traveling and to truly immerse yourself in the culture of the area.

For more adventurous travelers, camping is an option in some places, while resorts offer villas with private pools near some of Vietnam’s more scenic locations — perfect for couples looking for a romantic getaway! No matter what your preference and budget, Vietnam has something to offer everyone when it comes to accommodation.

## Food and Drink Specialities in Vietnam

Food and drink are an integral part of the culture in Vietnam and have been adapted from around the world. Local specialities include banh xeo, a Vietnamese savoury pancake made using turmeric, and cha ca La Vong, which is fish that has been marinated and cooked in a claypot with dill. Soups, or 'canh', are commonly eaten at breakfast and as a side dish throughout the day. Also popular is a large range of Vietnamese noodle dishes that use ingredients like pork, shrimp, vegetables, herbs and tamarind sauce to create unique flavours.

Coffee is big in Vietnam and widely consumed throughout the day; local specialities include egg coffee or 'ca phe trung', which contains whipped eggs mixed into strong black coffee with condensed milk added on top. Traditional teas are loved in Vietnam too — green tea is particularly popular — but chocolate milk tea tends to be more favored by younger generations. Rice wine can be found in many provinces and goes well with food such as pho bo (beef noodles), cha gio (spring rolls) and bun rieu (rice vermicelli soup). Beer has also become popular over recent years; among locals some of the most popular beers include 333 Export beer, Huda Beer from Hue City and Saigon beer from Ho Chi Minh City.

## Shopping in Vietnam

Whether you’re looking for luxury goods or bargain buys, shopping in Vietnam is an experience like no other. From bustling local markets to high-end boutiques in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, you can find an array of unique and interesting souvenirs to bring home.

For the traditional market experience, there are plenty of shopping hot spots in Hanoi. The Old Quarter is always buzzing with activity and sells anything from silk clothing to lacquerware. For souvenirs, head over to the Hang Gai Street where you’ll find plenty of shops selling locally made handicrafts as well as artwork by modern Vietnamese artists.

Here you can browse through a range of high-end fashion boutiques as well as interior design stores for something special for your home. Or perhaps if you want something unique or vintage, then don’t forget about back street alleys where dozens of antique stores are located! Lastly, don't forget about Ben Thanh Market which is home to countless stalls selling jewellery, fishing supplies and more! Whatever it is that you have your heart set on finding during your holiday in Vietnam – we guarantee it’s here.
