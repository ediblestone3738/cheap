# Japan's Ancient Shinto Religion: Understanding its Practices and Beliefs

Japan is a country steeped in ancient customs and traditions, many of which are still practiced today. One of the most prominent of these is Shinto, the native religion of Japan. Shinto is a polytheistic religion that has been around since at least the 8th century BCE, and is based on the worship of kami, or spirits. Shinto is a vital part of Japanese culture and has had a profound influence on the country’s art, literature, and even its way of life. In this article, we’ll explore the history of Shinto, its beliefs and practices, and the top 10 tourist attractions related to the religion.

## History of Shinto

Shinto has its roots in the ancient animistic beliefs of the Japanese people. It is believed that the kami, or spirits, are present in all aspects of nature, from mountains and rivers to plants and animals. The ancient Japanese believed that these spirits could be propitiated and appeased through offerings and prayers. Over time, these animistic beliefs developed into a more formalized religion, with a set of rituals and beliefs.

The first written records of Shinto date back to the 8th century CE, when it was first mentioned in the Kojiki, a collection of ancient myths and legends. Since then, it has been an important part of Japanese culture, though it has also been influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism. During the Meiji period (1868-1912), Shinto was officially declared the state religion. After World War II, the government declared Shinto to be a religion of faith, rather than a state religion.

## Beliefs and Practices

Shinto is a polytheistic religion, with a pantheon of kami, or spirits, that are believed to inhabit all aspects of nature. These spirits are divided into two categories: kami of the land, and kami of the people. The kami of the land are believed to inhabit mountains, rivers, and other natural features, while the kami of the people are believed to inhabit humans and other living things.

Shinto does not have a single set of beliefs or teachings. Instead, it is a collection of rituals and practices that are meant to honor and appease the kami. These rituals include the offering of food and drink at shrines, the performance of purification rituals, and the recitation of prayers.
