- Noise: Hotels can be noisy, especially if they are located in busy areas. You may have to deal with the noise from other guests, as well as traffic and other outside noises.
- Cost: While hotels can be more affordable than renting an apartment or house, they can still be expensive. You may also have to pay extra for amenities such as Wi-Fi and parking.
