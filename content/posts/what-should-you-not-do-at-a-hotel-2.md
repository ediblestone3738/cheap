# What Should You Not Do at a Hotel?

As a travel expert, I'm often asked what are the things you should not do when staying at a hotel. While it's important to enjoy your stay, there are certain things that you should never do while staying at a hotel. Here are the top 10 things you must not do in a hotel room.

## \#10 Lying After Damaging Something

No matter how small or insignificant it may seem, never lie after damaging something in your hotel room. If you break something, admit it and take responsibility for it. Most hotels will understand and will be willing to work with you to resolve the issue.

## \#9 Leaving Jewelry and Money

It's always a good idea to keep your valuables safe and secure. Never leave jewelry or money in your hotel room. Most hotels have safes that you can use to store your valuables. If you don't have access to a safe, consider leaving your valuables with the front desk.

## \#8 Keeping Bathroom Door Unlocked when Taking a Shower

Always make sure to lock the bathroom door when taking a shower. Not only is it a safety precaution, but it's also a courtesy to other guests.

## \#7 Sneaking In Your Pets

Most hotels do not allow pets, so never try to sneak in your pet. Not only is it against the rules, but it can also be dangerous for your pet.

## \#6 Smoking

Smoking is not allowed in most hotels, so never smoke in your hotel room. Not only is it against the rules, but it can also be a fire hazard.

## \#5 Stealing from the Hotel

Never steal from the hotel. This includes taking items such as towels, linens, and other items that are not yours. Not only is it against the rules, but it can also be a criminal offense.

## \#4 Drinking Tap Water

Never drink the tap water in your hotel room. Most hotels provide bottled water for their guests, so make sure to use that instead.

## \#3 Cheating the Minibar

Never try to cheat the minibar. Most hotels have cameras in the minibar area, so they will know if you try to take something without paying for it.

## \#2 Not Paying for Room Service

Never try to get away with not paying for room service. Not only is it against the rules, but it can also be a criminal offense.

## \#1 Not Respecting Other Guests

Always be respectful of other guests in the hotel. This includes not making too much noise, not smoking in public areas, and not bringing in unregistered guests.

These are the top 10 things you must not do in a hotel room. By following these simple rules, you can ensure that you have a pleasant and enjoyable stay at your hotel.
