# Travelodge Prices: How to Save on Your Next Booking

All about Travelodge prices. If you’ve ever stayed at a [Travelodge](https://www.travelodge.co.uk/), you’ll know it’s one of the UK’s most popular budget hotel chains. With 600 hotels across the country, Travelodge has become the go-to choice for business travellers, families, and budget-conscious holidaymakers. But one question keeps popping up among frequent guests: do Travelodge prices go down if you wait to book? And if so, when is the best time to secure the cheapest room?

This guide takes a deep dive into how Travelodge sets its prices, whether costs drop during the week, and the smart booking strategies that can help you lock in a better deal. We’ll also explore online tools and price alerts that make bargain-hunting easier.

## Do Travelodge Prices Go Down?

The short answer: **yes — but not always.** Travelodge, like most hotel chains, uses a **dynamic pricing model**. That means room rates fluctuate depending on demand, availability, location, and time of booking.

### Why Prices Change

- **Demand-driven pricing:** Hotels charge more when demand is high (e.g., summer holidays, weekends, or when an event is happening nearby).

- **Advance booking discounts:** Travelodge often offers “Saver” rates, which are cheaper but non-refundable. These are usually available further in advance.

- **Last-minute deals:** If a hotel has spare rooms close to the date, prices can drop to encourage last-minute bookings.

### What Guests Often Notice

- Booking **months in advance** can sometimes be more expensive than waiting a few weeks, especially if demand is low.

- However, for popular city centres or hotels near attractions, waiting usually means **prices go up, not down**.

- Travelodge tends to balance both strategies — making some rooms cheaper for early birds, but releasing occasional last-minute discounts if hotels aren’t full.

**Takeaway:** Prices _can_ go down, but it depends heavily on location and timing. The safest way to save is to understand **when Travelodge is likely to lower rates**, which brings us to the next section.

## Best Days to Book Travelodge Rooms

When it comes to hotel pricing, not all days are equal. Some days of the week are more expensive, while others are prime for bargains.

### Midweek vs. Weekend

- **Weekends (Friday & Saturday):** Travelodge rooms are often more expensive in city centres and tourist destinations, as leisure travellers make bookings.

- **Weekdays (Monday–Thursday):** Business hotels in city centres may be pricier midweek, but Travelodge locations in holiday towns are often cheaper during the week.

### Example: 1-Week Price Snapshot

Here’s an example of how Travelodge prices can vary across a single week (sampled from a typical UK city location in autumn):

Day of WeekSample Price (Standard Double Room)NotesMonday£45Lower demand — often cheapest nightTuesday£42Common adjustment day — prices drop midweekWednesday£44Still low — good for business staysThursday£49Slight rise as weekend approachesFriday£65Weekend demand beginsSaturday£78Highest price of the week (leisure travellers)Sunday£50Drops again after the weekend peak

**Key takeaway:** If you’re flexible, aim for **Monday–Wednesday** stays — often 30–40% cheaper than Saturday.

### Cheapest Days to Book Online

According to booking patterns:

- **Tuesday and Wednesday** are often the best days to find lower rates when booking online. This is when hotels sometimes adjust prices after the weekend rush.

- Avoid **Friday evenings** — many people book weekend stays then, which pushes up prices.

### Advance vs. Last-Minute

- **Advance Saver Rates:** Best for people with firm plans. These are cheaper but non-refundable.

- **Last-Minute Bookings:** If a hotel isn’t full, Travelodge may release discounted rooms 1–3 days before check-in. However, in busy cities like London, Manchester, or Edinburgh, waiting is risky as prices usually rise.

### Seasonal Tips

- **Summer Holidays & Christmas:** Prices rise significantly; book as far ahead as possible.

- **Shoulder Seasons (March, late September, November):** Fewer travellers mean prices are more flexible, and you’re more likely to see reductions.

**Tip:** If you’re flexible, try searching for **different days of the week** and comparing. A Tuesday night in the same hotel can be half the price of a Saturday stay.

## Tips to Get the Cheapest Travelodge Rooms

Here’s where you can really save money. These practical strategies will help you beat the system and book a Travelodge room for less.

### 1\. Book Direct with Travelodge

While booking sites like Expedia or Booking.com sometimes offer deals, Travelodge **guarantees the lowest prices on its own website**. Plus, you’ll see room types that third-party sites don’t always list (like family rooms).

### 2\. Look for Travelodge Saver Rates

Travelodge offers **three main rate types**:

- **Saver Rate:** Cheapest option, but non-refundable.

- **Flexible Rate:** Costs more, but lets you cancel up to midday on the day of arrival.

- **Business Rate:** For corporate accounts.

If your travel plans are firm, always pick the **Saver Rate** to save up to 30%.

### 3\. Sign Up for Email Offers

Travelodge runs seasonal promotions (e.g., “rooms from £29”) but only promotes them via its email list. Signing up ensures you’re among the first to know.

### 4\. Check Different Locations

In big cities, you’ll often find **several Travelodge hotels within a few miles**. Prices can vary dramatically between them. For example, staying just outside central London (e.g., in Stratford or Croydon) can save you £50+ per night compared to Central London Travelodge hotels.

### 5\. Stay Midweek if Possible

If you’re visiting a tourist spot, aim for **Sunday–Thursday stays**. Prices often drop by 20–40% compared to weekends.

### 6\. Book Longer Stays

Sometimes, booking **two or three nights together** reduces the per-night price compared to one-night stays. Always compare both options.

### 7\. Use Cashback and Voucher Sites

Websites like **TopCashback** or **Quidco** often have Travelodge cashback offers (usually 3–5%). Combine this with a Saver Rate for maximum savings.

### 8\. Consider Alternative Travelodge Brands

Travelodge’s “SuperRooms” (upgraded rooms with more amenities) can sometimes be only £5–£10 extra. If a standard room is nearly full, you may find SuperRooms cheaper because of dynamic pricing.

### 9\. Use Membership Discounts (If Applicable)

Travelodge doesn’t have a loyalty program like Premier Inn or Holiday Inn, but sometimes employers, unions, or student groups offer **exclusive Travelodge discount codes**. It’s worth checking before booking.

## Tools and Alerts to Track Travelodge Prices

If you want to maximise your savings, using the right tools makes a huge difference.

### 1\. Google Hotels Price Tracking

Even if you plan to book direct with Travelodge, Google Hotels lets you:

- See price history for specific dates.

- Set alerts when a price drops.

### 2\. Trivago and Kayak

These price-comparison sites allow you to:

- Compare Travelodge prices across different booking sites.

- Spot if a hotel has quietly reduced its direct rate.

### 3\. Price Alert Extensions

Browser extensions like **Honey** or **CamelCamelCamel (via Amazon hotels integration)** sometimes work for Travelodge offers, showing when prices drop.

### 4\. Bing Travel Deals

Don’t ignore Bing’s built-in **travel search tool**. Searching “Travelodge \[city\]” in Bing often surfaces promotional prices and comparisons in the sidebar.

### 5\. Travelodge Prices App

Download the official Travelodge app. It sometimes has **exclusive mobile-only deals** not visible on the desktop site. Plus, you can manage bookings easily.

Travelodge remains one of the most affordable hotel options in the UK, but knowing **when and how to book** makes a huge difference. Prices do go down in certain situations — usually midweek, in off-peak seasons, or when hotels have unsold rooms close to the date. But for popular locations, prices only go one way: up.

To get the best deal:

- **Book direct** on Travelodge’s website.

- **Choose Saver Rates** when you’re confident of your plans.

- **Compare dates and locations** before finalising your booking.

- **Use price alerts and tools** to track drops.

By combining these strategies, you’ll not only save money but also secure the flexibility and convenience that makes Travelodge such a popular choice.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Travelodge Prices

### Do Travelodge rooms go on sale?

Yes, Travelodge often runs seasonal sales and special promotions. These can include discounted rooms from **£29 or less per night** in selected locations. Sales typically happen in **January**, **late spring**, and **September** to drive bookings in quieter periods. To catch these deals, it’s worth signing up for Travelodge’s email alerts.

### Are Travelodge rooms cheaper if you book in advance?

Generally, yes. Booking **4–6 weeks in advance** usually gets you lower rates than booking last minute. However, in some locations, prices may drop within the last week if occupancy is low. For the best balance, aim to book at least a month ahead.

### What is the cheapest day of the week to stay at Travelodge?

Based on pricing patterns, **Monday through Wednesday** are usually the cheapest nights to stay, especially in leisure destinations. **Saturdays** are the most expensive, as they coincide with weekend trips and city breaks.

### Does Travelodge offer student or group discounts?

Travelodge doesn’t have an official student discount, but large groups can often secure reduced rates by contacting the hotel directly. Schools, sports teams, and business groups may qualify for block booking discounts.

### Can I get a refund if Travelodge prices drop after I book?

No, Travelodge does not automatically adjust prices if they drop after booking. However, if you book a **Flexible Rate room**, you can cancel and rebook at the cheaper price (subject to availability). This is one of the best ways to lock in a lower rate.

### Do Travelodge rooms get cheaper on the day?

Occasionally. If a hotel has a lot of unsold rooms, prices may fall on the day of check-in. However, this is not guaranteed and often applies to less busy locations. If you need certainty, it’s safer to book early.

## Other Travelodge Policies You Should Know

When booking a stay at Travelodge, it’s worth being aware of a few policies that can affect your trip.

**Minimum Age Requirement**  
Travelodge requires guests to be **at least 18 years old** to book and stay in a room alone. Guests under 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. This is important for younger travellers planning solo stays — and it’s a policy that can vary slightly depending on location. (Read more  about [Travelodge’s minimum age policy](/cheap-holidays/united-kingdom/travelodge-minimum-age-to-stay/ "Travelodge Minimum Age to Stay").)

**Check-In and Check-Out Times**  
Standard check-in is from **3pm**, and check-out is by **12pm**. For more flexibility, you can purchase **early check-in** or **late check-out** options, often at an additional cost of around £10.

**Cancellations and Refunds**  
Travelodge offers two main rate types: **Saver Rate** (non-refundable, cheapest option) and **Flexible Rate** (allows cancellations and changes up to midday on the day of arrival).

**Pets Policy**  
Travelodge is **pet-friendly**, but there’s an extra charge per animal, and only certain types of pets are allowed.

By understanding these policies before you book, you can avoid surprises and make sure your stay goes smoothly.
