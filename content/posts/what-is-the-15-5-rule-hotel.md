# What is the 15/5 Rule in Hotels?

The 15/5 rule is a customer service standard that has been adopted by many hotels around the world. It is based on the idea that when a guest is within 15 feet of a hotel employee, they should be acknowledged in some way, such as with a smile or a nod. Similarly, when a guest is within 5 feet of a hotel employee, they should be greeted in an appropriate manner, such as with a “hello”, “good morning”, or “good evening”.

The 15/5 rule was first introduced in April 2013 by the InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), one of the world’s largest hotel companies. The rule was designed to ensure that guests receive a warm and friendly welcome when they enter a hotel. The idea behind the rule is that guests should feel welcomed and appreciated from the moment they enter the hotel.

## Why is the 15/5 Rule Important?

The 15/5 rule is important because it helps to create a positive customer experience. When guests are greeted warmly and with respect, they are more likely to feel valued and appreciated. This can lead to higher customer satisfaction, which can result in more repeat customers and increased revenue for the hotel.

The 15/5 rule also helps to create a sense of community in the hotel. When guests are greeted warmly and with respect, they are more likely to feel comfortable and at home. This can lead to a more enjoyable stay for the guest, which can lead to more positive reviews and more referrals.

## How Can Hotels Implement the 15/5 Rule?

Hotels can implement the 15/5 rule by training their staff to greet guests warmly and with respect. This can be done by having staff members practice the 15/5 rule in a simulated environment, such as a training room. Additionally, hotels can create a policy that outlines the 15/5 rule and outlines the expectations for staff members.

Hotels can also implement the 15/5 rule by having staff members wear name tags or uniforms that make them easily identifiable to guests. This can help to create a sense of familiarity and can make it easier for guests to identify who to greet.

## Conclusion

The 15/5 rule is an important customer service standard that has been adopted by many hotels around the world. It is based on the idea that when a guest is within 15 feet of a hotel employee, they should be acknowledged in some way, such as with a smile or a nod.
