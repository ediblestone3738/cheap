# Do Hotel Prices Go Down the Longer You Wait?

Do you wait until the last minute to book a hotel room, or do you book in advance? The answer may surprise you – hotel prices actually decline the longer you wait. According to Shank, the CEO of HotelTonight, same-day rates on HotelTonight are, on average, 10 percent less than if you book the day before.

## Why Do Hotel Prices Go Down?

Hotel prices go down the longer you wait because hotels want to fill their rooms. If a hotel has a lot of empty rooms, they are more likely to lower their prices in order to attract more customers. This is especially true for hotels that are located in tourist destinations, where there is a lot of competition.

## How Can You Take Advantage of Lower Prices?

If you are looking to take advantage of lower hotel prices, there are a few things you can do. First, you should book your hotel as far in advance as possible. This will give you the best chance of getting the lowest price.

Second, you should keep an eye on hotel prices. If you notice that the price of a hotel is dropping, you should book it right away. This will ensure that you get the best deal.

Finally, you should consider using a hotel booking app such as HotelTonight. This app allows you to book same-day hotel rooms at a discounted rate.

## Tips for Finding the Best Deals

If you want to find the best deals on hotel rooms, there are a few tips you should keep in mind. First, you should always compare prices between different hotels. This will help you find the best deal.

Second, you should consider using a hotel booking app such as HotelTonight. This app allows you to book same-day hotel rooms at a discounted rate.

Finally, you should consider using a hotel rewards program. Many hotels offer rewards programs that allow you to earn points for every dollar you spend. These points can then be used to get discounts on future hotel stays.

## Conclusion

Hotel prices actually decline the longer you wait. This is because hotels want to fill their rooms, and they are more likely to lower their prices in order to attract more customers. If you want to take advantage of lower hotel prices, you should book your hotel as far in advance as possible, keep an eye on hotel prices, and consider using a hotel booking app such as HotelTonight. Additionally, you should always compare prices between different hotels, consider using a hotel rewards program, and use a hotel booking app such as HotelTonight.

By following these tips, you can ensure that you get the best deal on your next hotel stay. So, don't wait – book your hotel now and start saving!
