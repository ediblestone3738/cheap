# Do Holiday Prices Go Up the More You Look?

Have you ever wondered if the more you look at holiday prices, the higher they get? It's a long-held theory that prices increase when you keep checking them, but recent data suggests this isn't true. In this blog post, we'll explore the concept of 'dynamic pricing' and whether or not it's actually affecting holiday prices.

## What is Dynamic Pricing?

Dynamic pricing is a pricing strategy used by many companies, including airlines, to adjust prices according to the demand for a particular product or service. It works by using algorithms to track customer behaviour and adjust prices accordingly. For example, if an airline notices that more people are booking flights to a certain destination, they may increase the price of those flights to take advantage of the increased demand.

## Does Dynamic Pricing Affect Holiday Prices?

The short answer is no. Although dynamic pricing does exist, it's not used to bump up prices when customers are browsing for holidays. In fact, most airlines and travel companies use dynamic pricing to lower prices when there is less demand for a particular destination or flight.

However, there is some evidence to suggest that prices may go up if you keep checking the same flight or destination. This is because the algorithms used by airlines and travel companies can track your browsing history and may adjust prices accordingly.

## How Can You Avoid Dynamic Pricing?

The best way to avoid dynamic pricing is to shop around and compare prices from different airlines and travel companies. This will ensure that you get the best deal and avoid any potential price hikes due to dynamic pricing.

It's also important to remember that prices can fluctuate due to a variety of factors, such as seasonality, availability and demand. So even if you find a good deal, it's always worth checking back regularly to see if the price has changed.

## Conclusion

The concept of dynamic pricing has been around for a while, but it's not used to bump up holiday prices when customers are browsing. However, there is some evidence to suggest that prices may go up if you keep checking the same flight or destination. To avoid this, it's best to shop around and compare prices from different airlines and travel companies.

Overall, the theory that holiday prices go up the more you look is largely unfounded. So don't be afraid to browse around and compare prices - you could save yourself some money in the long run!
