Nestled on the southern coast of France, Nice offers breathtaking sea views, charming old streets, and hidden corners that many visitors never see. It's no wonder that the city has long been a popular destination for tourists. But there's more to Nice than the obvious tourist spots. To get the most out of your trip to Nice, consider seeking out some of the hidden gems that only locals know about.

As a resident of Nice for many years, I've come to know the city very well. Here's my guide to discovering the hidden gems of Nice.

1\. Old Town
Start your exploration of Nice by wandering through the winding cobblestone streets of the Old Town, known as "Vieux Nice." This charming historic quarter is filled with colorful buildings and lively cafes. You'll find plenty of locals here, shopping for fresh produce or sipping coffee at outdoor tables.

2\. Castle Hill
The Castle Hill is a natural park that towers high over the city. It was once home to a fort, but now offers some of the best views of Nice. The climb up can be a bit steep, but it's worth it for the stunning panorama of Nice and the Mediterranean Sea.

3\. The Flower Market
No visit to Nice is complete without a visit to the Cours Saleya, the flower and food market in the Old Town. You'll find colorful stalls selling local produce, artisanal cheeses, and fresh flowers. Be sure to go early in the morning, when the market is at its busiest.

4\. The Promenade des Anglais
This iconic promenade runs along the edge of the sea and is a favorite spot for locals and tourists alike. You'll find runners, dog walkers, and cyclists enjoying the view here, and there are plenty of cafes and bars where you can sit, sip a coffee or a glass of wine, and take it all in.

5\. Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild
This stunning villa is located just outside of Nice in the town of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat. It was built in the early 20th century by the Rothschild family and is open to the public for tours. The gardens are particularly impressive, with nine different themes, including a Japanese garden, a Spanish garden, and a rose garden.

6\. Place Garibaldi
This lively square is home to some of Nice's best bars and restaurants. It's a great spot to grab a drink or a bite to eat, especially in the evening when the square is bathed in twinkling lights.

7\. Musée Matisse
Nice was home to the famous artist Henri Matisse for many years, and this museum is dedicated to his life and work. You'll find an impressive collection of paintings, sculptures, and drawings here, as well as some personal effects of Matisse.

8\. Le Negresco Hotel
This famous hotel has been a fixture on the Promenade des Anglais since 1913. Even if you're not staying here, it's worth visiting just to see the opulent interior decor and the collection of art and antiques.

9\. Castle Park
Located just a short walk from the Old Town, this peaceful park offers some of the best views of Nice from a different perspective. The park is filled with winding paths, shady trees, and fountains, making it a great spot for a picnic or a quiet afternoon stroll.

10\. Chagall Museum
Located in the Cimiez neighborhood, this museum is dedicated to the works of the artist Marc Chagall. You'll find a comprehensive collection of his paintings, as well as some sculptures and stained glass windows.

A: Nice can be quite expensive, especially during peak tourist season. However, there are plenty of affordable options for food and lodging if you're willing to venture off the beaten path.

Q: What's the best time of year to visit Nice?
