Why Lefkada Should Be Your Next Island Destination

Lefkada, also known as Lefkas, is a Greek island located in the Ionian Sea, just off the west coast of mainland Greece. It is a hidden gem that offers everything a traveler could want from an island: majestic beaches, crystal-clear waters, rich history, and mouth-watering cuisine. Despite its beauty, Lefkada is not as well-known as other Greek islands, which makes it the perfect destination for those looking for an authentic and less crowded Greek experience. In this article, we’ll explore why Lefkada should be your next island destination and what it has to offer.

Lefkada is easy to reach

You can either fly directly to Aktion Airport, located on the mainland, or take a ferry from nearby islands such as Corfu, Kefalonia, and Zakynthos. Once you arrive, you can rent a car or use public transportation to explore the island.

Lefkada has some of the most beautiful beaches in Greece

Lefkada is home to some of the most stunning beaches in Greece. The island boasts over 40 beaches, each with its own unique charm. Porto Katsiki, considered one of the top beaches in Greece, is a must-visit. It is located on the southwest coast of the island and features turquoise waters, white sand, and steep cliffs. Egremni Beach, another popular beach in Lefkada, offers a long stretch of white sand and is famous for its crystal-clear waters.

The town of Lefkada, the island’s capital, features a Venetian castle and several churches dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries.
