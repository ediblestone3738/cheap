### The Enchanting History of Longleat Safari Park



Nestled in the picturesque Wiltshire countryside, Longleat Safari Park is steeped in a fascinating history that dates back to the Elizabethan era. Originally the stately home of the Thynn family, Longleat House was completed in 1580 and is often hailed as one of the finest examples of Elizabethan architecture. The estate’s transformation into a safari park in 1966 was a revolutionary concept for its time, marking a departure from traditional zoos and paving the way for a new model of animal conservation and public engagement.



Inspired by his travels to Africa, Ceawlin Thynn, the 7th Marquess of Bath, introduced the idea of an African safari experience in the UK. The park opened with just a few exotic species, including lions and tigers, and quickly gained popularity. Today, it spans over 900 acres and features more than 150 species of animals, offering visitors an opportunity to experience a bit of the savannah without ever stepping foot outside England.



### Getting to Longleat Safari Park



Longleat Safari Park is conveniently located near the charming town of Warminster, about an hour and a half drive from London and easily accessible via the A36 and A350 roads. For those relying on public transportation, Warminster train station is the nearest rail link, with regular services connecting to major cities in the UK. Upon arriving, a short taxi ride or a local bus will take you directly to the park.



Planning your journey ahead of time can save both time and hassle. If you’re driving, consider taking the A303, which offers scenic views of the rolling hills of Wiltshire and is often less congested than alternative routes. It’s worth noting that the park has ample parking, including spaces for coaches and larger vehicles, making it accessible for groups and families alike.

Don’t miss the opportunity to feed these gentle giants; the experience is exhilarating and will leave you with lasting memories. Along your journey, look out for the park’s famed troop of monkeys, known for their playful antics.



Another must-see is the Longleat Hedge Maze, one of the largest in the UK. Designed in the 1970s and stretching over 1.5 miles, winding pathways lead to hidden surprises, including an impressive giant’s chair that provides a perfect photo opportunity. The maze offers an enjoyable challenge for visitors of all ages and serves as a delightful diversion from the main park attractions.
