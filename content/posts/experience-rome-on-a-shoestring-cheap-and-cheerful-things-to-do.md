Experience Rome on a Shoestring: Cheap and Cheerful Things to Do

Rome, the Eternal City, is one of the most visited cities in the world. The city is home to ancient ruins, cathedrals, museums, and art galleries, making it a treasure trove for culturally curious travelers. However, Rome can also be quite an expensive city to visit, especially for those who are on a tight budget. But, with a little bit of planning, it is possible to experience the best of Rome on a shoestring budget.

Here is a guide to experiencing Rome on a shoestring: Cheap and Cheerful Things to Do.

1\. Take a free walking tour: There are many free walking tours available in Rome that will take you to some of the most popular attractions in the city. Some of the best tours include the Vatican City tour, the Colosseum and Roman Forum tour, and the Jewish Ghetto tour.

2\. Visit the Pantheon: The Pantheon is one of the most iconic landmarks in Rome, and the good news is that it is completely free to visit. The Pantheon was originally a temple to all the gods of Ancient Rome, and it is now a church.

3\. Explore Trastevere: Trastevere is a trendy neighborhood in Rome that is perfect for a leisurely stroll. The streets are narrow and winding, and there are many cafes and restaurants to explore, serving food and drink at reasonable prices.

4\. Visit the Trevi Fountain: The Trevi Fountain is one of the most famous fountains in the world and is a must-visit attraction in Rome. While it is customary to throw a coin into the fountain for good luck, it is not mandatory.

5\. Visit the Sistine Chapel: The Sistine Chapel is one of the most famous landmarks in Rome due to Michelangelo’s ceiling painting. Though a ticket to the Vatican Museums is required, there are days in the month when the Sistine Chapel is free of charge to all visitors.

8\. Visit the Colosseum: The Colosseum is one of Rome’s most impressive landmarks, and a great place to visit on a budget. While there is an admission fee, the ticket includes admission to the Palatine Hill (combined ticket with Roman Forum) and is well worth the cost.
