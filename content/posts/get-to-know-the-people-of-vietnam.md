Vietnam is a country steeped in history, culture, and natural beauty. From its stunning landscapes to its bustling cities, there is no shortage of things to do and see in this Southeast Asian gem. But, while most tourists come to Vietnam to visit its iconic sights, such as Halong Bay or the ancient town of Hoi An, the real magic of Vietnam lies in its people.

As you travel through Vietnam, you'll quickly realize that the Vietnamese are some of the friendliest people in the world, eager to share their culture, cuisine, and daily lives with outsiders.
