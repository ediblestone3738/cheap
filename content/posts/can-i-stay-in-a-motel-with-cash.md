# Can I Stay in a Motel with Cash?

As a travel expert, I often get asked the question: Can I stay in a motel with cash? The answer is yes, as of 2021, there is no federal law in the United States that prevents a hotel from refusing cash payments. However, it is important to note that some hotels may have a credit-card-only policy that must be communicated to the guest before they stay at the property.

## Why Do Some Hotels Refuse Cash Payments?

There are a few reasons why some hotels may refuse cash payments. One of the most common reasons is to reduce the risk of theft. Hotels are often targets for criminals, and cash payments can be more difficult to track than credit card payments. Additionally, cash payments can also be more difficult to reconcile, as it is harder to keep track of how much money is coming in and out of the hotel.

## What Are the Benefits of Paying with Cash?

Paying with cash can be beneficial for a few reasons. First, it can help you avoid credit card fees. Credit card companies often charge fees for processing payments, which can add up over time. Additionally, paying with cash can also help you stay within your budget. When you pay with cash, you can only spend what you have, which can help you avoid overspending.

## How Can I Find Hotels That Accept Cash Payments?

If you are looking for a hotel that accepts cash payments, there are a few ways to find one. First, you can call the hotel directly and ask if they accept cash payments. Additionally, you can also search online for hotels that accept cash payments. There are a few websites that specialize in helping travelers find hotels that accept cash payments.

## What Are the Alternatives to Cash Payments?

If you are unable to find a hotel that accepts cash payments, there are a few alternatives. One option is to use a prepaid debit card. Prepaid debit cards are accepted at most hotels and can be used to pay for your stay. Additionally, you can also use a money order or traveler’s check. Money orders and traveler’s checks are also accepted at most hotels and can be used to pay for your stay.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, as of 2021, there is no federal law in the United States that prevents a hotel from refusing cash payments. However, it is important to note that some hotels may have a credit-card-only policy that must be communicated to the guest before they stay at the property.
