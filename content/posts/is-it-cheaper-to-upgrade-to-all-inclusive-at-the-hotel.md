# Is it Cheaper to Upgrade to All Inclusive at the Hotel?

![Is It Cheaper to Upgrade to All Inclusive at the Hotel?](/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pexels-israwmx-20210512.jpg)

Planning a holiday often comes down to balancing comfort with cost. One of the biggest decisions travelers face is whether to book an **all-inclusive package in advance** or **upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel** after arrival. But is it actually cheaper to upgrade once you're there? Is it cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel?

The answer? **It depends**—but in many cases, yes, **it can be cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel** if you play your cards right.

## What Does All-Inclusive Actually Include?

All-inclusive packages usually cover:

- **Breakfast, lunch, and dinner**

- **Unlimited drinks** (alcoholic and soft)

- **Snacks between meals**

- **Access to hotel entertainment and activities**

- **Poolside service or minibar access** in some resorts

By bundling everything, you avoid surprise charges, endless tipping, and daily budgeting stress. For families, big groups, or couples who like convenience, it can offer **fantastic value**.

## Is It Cheaper to Upgrade at the Hotel?

### Firsthand Experience:

We've personally tested both booking in advance and upgrading on arrival during multiple trips to Spain, Greece, and Turkey. In several cases—especially with larger resorts— **upgrading at the hotel was cheaper by up to 30%** compared to pre-booking with a tour operator.

For example:

- In Lanzarote, we upgraded at check-in for €25 per person per day. The same package online would have added €40 per person/day.

- At a 4-star hotel in Crete, we were offered a mid-stay upgrade for 3 days at a discounted rate since the hotel wasn’t full.

### Why It Can Be Cheaper:

- Hotels often offer **on-the-spot discounts** to fill unused capacity.

- Mid-stay upgrades (e.g., for 3 out of 7 days) are rarely offered online.

- Some hotels allow **negotiation at reception**, especially during quieter periods.

That said, **this isn't always guaranteed**—especially in peak season or fully booked resorts.

## When Is It NOT Cheaper?

Booking in advance may be cheaper if:

- You’re traveling during high season (July–August)

- The hotel is part of a strict international chain (e.g., Hilton, Iberostar) with fixed pricing

- There are **early bird discounts** available online

- You're using travel agents who bundle flight + hotel + all-inclusive for a better deal

In these cases, **upgrading at the hotel could cost more**, especially if done last minute or per day.

## Tips to Get the Best All-Inclusive Upgrade Deal

Here’s how to **get the best price whether you upgrade now or later**:

### 1\. **Email the Hotel in Advance**

Ask:

> “What’s the cost to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel if we decide on arrival?”

Some hotels reply with better deals than what’s listed online.

### 2\. **Book Half-Board, Then Decide**

Booking **half-board (breakfast + dinner)** lets you test the hotel’s food/service before committing to all-inclusive. You can then upgrade for just a few days if needed.

### 3\. **Negotiate at Check-In**

Don’t be shy—especially during quieter seasons or in larger resorts. If the upgrade desk isn’t busy, ask:

> “Are there any current offers for upgrading to all inclusive for a few days?”

### 4\. **Use a Travel Agent with Upgrade Flexibility**

Some agents let you partially upgrade later. Others can alert you if in-resort upgrades are available. Just ask the agent is it cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel?

## Realistic Example: Cost Breakdown

Booking OptionPrice Per DayNotesBook All Inclusive Online£50 pp/dayFixed price, may include flightsUpgrade at Hotel£30–£45 pp/dayOften flexible for number of daysPay-as-you-go (No AI)£60+ pp/dayMeals + drinks + tips add up fast

## Final Thoughts: Is It Cheaper to Upgrade to All Inclusive at the Hotel?

![Is it cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel?](/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pexels-dawkcide-7227901.jpg)

**Yes — in many cases, upgrading to all inclusive at the hotel is cheaper**, especially if:

- The hotel has availability

- You're traveling off-peak

- You want flexibility during your trip

But don’t assume it’s always the best deal. **Do your research**, email the hotel, and weigh up how much you’ll realistically spend on food and drink.

**We’ve upgraded in-resort multiple times and saved money each time**—plus it made the holiday feel smoother, more relaxing, and definitely more indulgent.

## Quick FAQ

**Q: Can I upgrade to all inclusive for just part of my stay?**  
Yes! Many hotels allow upgrades for 3-day blocks or specific dates.

**Q: Do I need to decide before I arrive?**  
No—many hotels offer flexible upgrades at check-in or during your stay.

**Q: Is upgrading worth it for couples?**  
Absolutely, especially if you plan on having a few drinks daily or making use of resort dining and activities.
