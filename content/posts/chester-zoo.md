### The Enchanting History of Chester Zoo



Established in 1931, Chester Zoo stands as a pivotal institution in animal conservation and education, making it one of the largest and most famous zoos in the United Kingdom. The zoo was founded by George Mottershead, whose vision encompassed the idea of offering animals a habitat that entire replicas of their natural environments. The initial collection was humble, comprising just a handful of animals, but it has since burgeoned to host over 21,000 animals and 500 species from around the globe.



George Mottershead’s innovative approach to zoo design laid the groundwork for a revolutionary way of keeping animals. His philosophy centered on the notion that animals should live in settings that mirror their natural habitats, rather than in traditional cages.
