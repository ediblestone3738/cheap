Las Vegas: The Entertainment Capital of the World

Welcome to Las Vegas, the city that never sleeps! Known as the Entertainment Capital of the World, it's no surprise that Las Vegas is one of the top tourist destinations in the United States. From the dazzling lights of the Las Vegas Strip, to the glimmering casinos, to the countless shows, attractions and fine dining options, there's no shortage of things to do in Vegas.

History of Las Vegas

But before we dive into all the exciting things that Las Vegas has to offer, let's take a brief look at the city's history. Although Las Vegas is now widely known as a gambling mecca, it wasn't always that way. Since its inception in 1905, the city relied heavily on the railroad and mining industries, until the state of Nevada legalized gambling in 1931. This change in legislation jumpstarted the development of the now-famous Las Vegas Strip, which is home to some of the most iconic casinos and hotels in the world.

The Las Vegas Strip

Stretching over 4 miles long, the Las Vegas Strip is a world-renowned destination in itself. From the Bellagio's spectacular water fountain show to the Venetian's breathtaking indoor canal, the Strip is home to some of the most impressive and extravagant attractions on the planet. But if you're more interested in gambling, you'll find no shortage of casinos lining the Strip, including the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, the MGM Grand, and the Wynn.
