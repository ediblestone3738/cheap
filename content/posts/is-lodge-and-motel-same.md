# Is Lodge and Motel Same?

When it comes to lodging, it can be confusing to differentiate between a lodge and a motel. Both are places to stay while travelling, but they are quite different in terms of amenities, services, and locations. In this article, we will discuss the differences between a lodge and a motel, and help you decide which one is best for your next trip.

## What is a Motel?

A motel is a type of lodging that is designed for travellers who are on the go. It is short for “motor hotel”, and it typically features exterior corridors and individual rooms that are accessible from the outside. Motels are usually located near highways and other major roads, and they offer convenient access to restaurants, gas stations, and other services. They are usually more affordable than hotels, and they are ideal for travellers who are looking for a place to stay for a night or two.

## What is a Lodge?

A lodge is a type of lodging that is usually located in a rural or rustic area. It is typically a hotel, and the building itself is often rustic in style. Lodges are usually located in areas with natural beauty, such as mountains, forests, or lakes. They offer a more secluded and peaceful atmosphere than motels, and they are ideal for travellers who are looking for a relaxing getaway. Lodges often offer additional amenities such as spas, restaurants, and recreational activities.
