It became an independent kingdom in the 10th century, and then a French colony in the 19th century. After the French were defeated in 1954, the country was divided into North and South Vietnam, with the North being controlled by the communist forces and the South by the US-backed government. The two sides eventually reunited in 1975, and since then the country has been gradually opening up to the world.
