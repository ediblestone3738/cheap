# What is INN Short For?

When it comes to the world of pharmaceuticals, it can be difficult to keep track of all the different names and abbreviations used to refer to the same thing. One of the most common abbreviations you’ll come across is INN, which stands for International Nonproprietary Names. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what INN is and how it is used in the pharmaceutical industry.

## What is INN?

INN is an acronym for International Nonproprietary Names. It is a system of naming pharmaceutical substances or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). INN is designed to provide a unique name for each pharmaceutical substance or API, so that it can be easily identified and tracked.

The purpose of INN is to facilitate the identification of pharmaceutical substances or APIs. This is especially important in the case of generic drugs, which are often produced by different manufacturers and have different brand names. By using the same INN for each drug, healthcare professionals and patients can easily identify the drug regardless of its brand name.

## How is INN Used?

INN is used to identify pharmaceutical substances or APIs in a variety of ways. It is used in medical literature, regulatory documents, and product labels. It is also used to identify drugs in databases and on the internet.

In addition, INN is used to ensure that drugs are safe and effective. This is because INN is used to identify the active ingredients in a drug, so that healthcare professionals can be sure that the drug contains the correct ingredients. This helps to ensure that the drug is safe and effective for its intended use.

## Who Develops INN?

INN is developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO works with a committee of experts to develop and maintain the INN system. This committee is known as the International Nonproprietary Names (INN) Expert Group.

The INN Expert Group is responsible for selecting the names for new pharmaceutical substances or APIs. The names must be unique, so that they can be easily identified and tracked. The names must also be easy to pronounce and remember, so that healthcare professionals and patients can easily identify the drug.

## Conclusion

INN is an acronym for International Nonproprietary Names. It is a system of naming pharmaceutical substances or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). INN is designed to provide a unique name for each pharmaceutical substance or API, so that it can be easily identified and tracked. INN is used to identify pharmaceutical substances or APIs in a variety of ways, including medical literature, regulatory documents, product labels, databases, and the internet. The INN system is maintained by the International Nonproprietary Names (INN) Expert Group, which is responsible for selecting the names for new pharmaceutical substances or APIs.
