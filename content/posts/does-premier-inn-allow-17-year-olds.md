# Does Premier Inn Allow 17 Year Olds?

As a travel expert, I often get asked questions about the policies of different hotels. One of the most common questions I get asked is whether Premier Inn allows 17 year olds to stay in their hotels.

The answer is yes, but with some caveats. Premier Inn allows 17 year olds to stay in their hotels, but occupancy is not transferable. That means that if a 17 year old is staying in a Premier Inn hotel, a parent or guardian must also be staying in the hotel.

## Why Does Premier Inn Have This Policy?

Premier Inn has this policy in place for a number of reasons. The first is safety. Premier Inn wants to ensure that all of their guests are safe and secure during their stay. By requiring a parent or guardian to stay in the hotel with a 17 year old, they can ensure that the guest is properly supervised.

The second reason is to ensure that the hotel is not used for any illegal activities. By requiring a parent or guardian to stay in the hotel with a 17 year old, Premier Inn can ensure that the hotel is not being used for any activities that are not allowed by law.

## What Are the Alternatives for 17 Year Olds?

If a 17 year old is looking for a place to stay, there are a few alternatives to Premier Inn. One option is to stay in a hostel. Hostels are generally more affordable than hotels, and they often have more relaxed policies when it comes to age restrictions.

Another option is to stay in a vacation rental. Vacation rentals are a great option for 17 year olds, as they often have more flexible policies when it comes to age restrictions. Vacation rentals also offer more privacy and space than a hotel, which can be a great option for 17 year olds who are looking for a place to stay.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Premier Inn does allow 17 year olds to stay in their hotels, but occupancy is not transferable. That means that a parent or guardian must also be staying in the hotel with the 17 year old. This policy is in place for safety and to ensure that the hotel is not used for any illegal activities.

If a 17 year old is looking for a place to stay, there are a few alternatives to Premier Inn. Hostels and vacation rentals are both great options for 17 year olds, as they often have more relaxed policies when it comes to age restrictions.

No matter where you choose to stay, it's important to make sure that you are following all of the rules and regulations of the hotel or rental property. That way, you can ensure that you have a safe and enjoyable stay.
