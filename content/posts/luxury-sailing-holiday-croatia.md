## Why Sail in Croatia?



Croatia’s Adriatic coastline is famed for its idyllic landscapes and vibrant culture. With over a thousand islands, each with its unique character, sailing offers a fantastic way to explore the country’s rich treasures. The opportunities to discover hidden coves, swim in turquoise waters, and dock at picturesque towns provide an unparalleled adventure.

As you set sail towards Hvar, you’ll be welcomed by mesmerizing lavender fields and vibrant nightlife. The town boasts historic streets, perfect for wandering, alongside excellent dining options offering fresh seafood and local delicacies.



### Vis and Korčula: Sister Islands Steeped in Heritage



Sailing onwards to Vis, travelers can enjoy its laid-back atmosphere and untouched nature, famous for the Blue Cave – an ethereal natural light show within a cave. Korčula, often hailed as the birthplace of Marco Polo, presents charming cobbled streets and traditional architecture, making it a must-visit.



## Natural Highlights to Discover

### Kornati National Park: An Archipelago Like No Other



No sailing journey in Croatia is complete without visiting Kornati National Park. An archipelago of 89 islands, it is known for its stark natural beauty and rich biodiversity. With crystal-clear waters and secluded bays, it’s an idyllic place for relaxation and exploration.



## Practical Information for Your Sailing Adventure



### Best Time to Sail



The best time for a Croatia sailing holiday is from late May to September. During these months, the weather is warm and stable, perfect for exploring the coast. July and August are peak months, so consider sailing in June or September for a more peaceful experience with fewer tourists.

- **Catamarans:** Ideal for family trips, offering spacious living areas and stability on the water.

- **Gulets:** Traditional wooden sailing vessels that provide a charming, authentic sailing experience.




### Charter with or Without a Skipper?



Deciding whether to charter with or without a skipper depends on your sailing experience. If you're familiar with sailing and navigating, chartering without a skipper gives you complete freedom. However, if you prefer to relax and enjoy the views, hiring a local skipper can provide valuable insights into the best spots to explore and navigate.

- Gulets, with crew included, typically range from €3,000 to €8,000.




Don’t forget to factor in additional costs such as fuel, port fees, and provisioning, which can add up to about €200-€500 more per week.



## Cultural and Culinary Insights



### Delicious Dishes to Try



Your sailing holiday isn’t just about beautiful sights; it’s also an opportunity to indulge in the local cuisine. Be sure to try:




- **Seafood:** Freshly caught fish and shellfish are staples along the coast.

- **Peka:** A traditional dish of meat or seafood slow-cooked under a bell-like lid.

- **Truffles:** Found in Istria, these gourmet fungi are a must-try.




### Wine and Tradition



Croatia is home to a variety of delicious wines, such as Plavac Mali and Pošip. Both regions have their vineyards, and sampling local wine adds depth to your holiday experience.
