# Do Flights Get Cheaper the Longer You Wait?

As a travel expert, I often get asked if flights get cheaper the longer you wait. The answer is yes, but there are some important factors to consider.

## Why Do Flight Prices Change?

Airlines typically start releasing tickets almost a year before the flight, and prices are usually higher when first released. As the day of travel approaches, the prices tend to get cheaper. This is because airlines want to fill their planes and make sure they don't have any empty seats. So, they lower the prices to attract more customers.

## When Should You Buy a Flight?

Buying a ticket too far in advance doesn't help you save money. Generally, the best time to buy a flight is around six weeks before the departure date. At this point, the prices are usually at their lowest.

## What If You Need to Buy a Flight Last Minute?

If you need to buy a flight last minute, you may be able to find some good deals. Airlines may be willing to offer discounts on last-minute tickets to fill their planes. However, these discounts may not be as good as the discounts available for tickets purchased further in advance.

## How Can You Find the Best Deals?

The best way to find the best deals on flights is to be flexible with your travel dates. Try to avoid travelling during peak times, such as holidays and school breaks. Also, consider flying on weekdays, as prices tend to be lower than on weekends.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, flights do get cheaper the longer you wait, but there are some important factors to consider. Generally, the best time to buy a flight is around six weeks before the departure date. However, if you need to buy a flight last minute, you may be able to find some good deals. To get the best deals, be flexible with your travel dates and consider flying on weekdays.
