Montenegro – the hidden gem of the Balkans – has been steadily gaining popularity among travelers in recent years. With its picturesque coastline, rugged mountains, historic cities, and a rich cultural heritage, it's no surprise that more and more people are adding Montenegro to their travel bucket list. In this in-depth travel article, we will explore the best things to see and do in Montenegro, its history, culture, and cuisine, and answer some frequently asked questions to help you plan your trip.

1\. History and Culture of Montenegro

Montenegro's history dates back to the early medieval period when the country was part of the Serbian Kingdom. In the 15th century, Montenegro became an independent state, ruled by the House of Petrovic-Njegos, which remained in power until the country's accession to Yugoslavia in 1918. During World War II, Montenegro was occupied by Italy, and later by Germany, and became part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia after the war.

Today, Montenegro is a parliamentary republic, with a population of around 620,000 people. The country is known for its rich cultural heritage, which includes a mixture of Slavic, Ottoman, and Mediterranean influences. The old town of Kotor, for instance, reflects the Venetian architecture, while the capital city of Podgorica showcases Ottoman-style buildings.

Budva – often described as the "Montenegrin Miami," Budva boasts some of the best beaches in the country, vibrant nightlife, and an old town that dates back to the 5th century. The old town features narrow alleyways, lined with traditional sandstone houses, and a Venetian fortress that offers breathtaking views of the Adriatic Sea.

Durmitor National Park – home to the country's highest mountain range, Durmitor National Park is a paradise for adventure seekers. The park offers hiking, cycling, rafting, and skiing opportunities, as well as stunning scenery, glacial lakes, and limestone canyons.
