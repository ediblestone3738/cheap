# What Summer Month is the Cheapest to Fly?

Summer is a great time to travel, but it can also be an expensive time to fly. With the start of summer's peak season, prices tend to skyrocket. But if you know when to book your flights, you can save a lot of money. In this blog post, we'll explore the best months to fly during the summer to get the cheapest fares.

## June

The first half of June is a relatively cheap time to fly, compared to prices that kick in June 22, which marks the start of summer's peak season. If you can book your flights before June 22, you'll likely get a better deal. However, if you can't, you may still be able to find some good deals if you're flexible with your travel dates.

## August

August is another great month to fly if you're looking for a good deal. Fly on or after Aug. 25, when cheaper fall fares start kick-in; it gets even cheaper in September and October. If you're willing to wait until the end of August, you can find some great deals.

## Tips for Finding Cheap Flights

When it comes to finding the cheapest flights, there are a few tips that can help you save money. Here are some of the best tips for finding the best deals:

- Book your flights as early as possible. Prices tend to go up the closer you get to the date of your flight.
- Be flexible with your travel dates. You may be able to find cheaper flights if you're willing to fly on different days.
- Compare prices across different airlines. Different airlines offer different prices, so it pays to shop around.
- Sign up for airline newsletters. Many airlines offer discounts and special offers to subscribers.
- Look for deals on travel websites. There are many websites that offer discounted flights, so it pays to check them out.

## Conclusion

Summer is a great time to travel, but it can also be an expensive time to fly. However, if you know when to book your flights, you can save a lot of money. June and August are both great months to fly if you're looking for a good deal. Be sure to book your flights as early as possible, be flexible with your travel dates, compare prices across different airlines, sign up for airline newsletters, and look for deals on travel websites. With these tips, you can find the best deals and save money on your summer flights.
