# How Early Should I Book Flights to Get the Lowest Price?

When it comes to booking flights, everyone wants to get the best deal possible. But when is the best time to book a flight to get the lowest price?

According to the site's analysts, prices will be lowest three to six weeks before your trip, rising rapidly in the last three weeks before departure date. That puts the optimal booking window range from 21 days to about 45 days before travel.

## The Benefits of Booking Early

Booking your flight early can have many benefits. Not only can you get the lowest price, but you also have more options when it comes to selecting your flight. Airlines often release seats at different prices and times, so the earlier you book, the more likely you are to get the flight and seat you want.

In addition, booking early can also help you save money on other aspects of your trip. Hotels, car rentals, and other travel expenses often go up in price as the departure date approaches, so booking your flight early can help you save money on those as well.

## Tips for Booking Early

When it comes to booking your flight, there are a few tips that can help you get the best deal.

First, be flexible with your travel dates. Airlines often have different prices for different days, so if you can be flexible with your travel dates, you may be able to find a cheaper flight.

Second, use a flight search engine to compare prices. Flight search engines like Skyscanner or Kayak can help you compare prices from different airlines and find the best deal.

Finally, sign up for airline newsletters. Airlines often offer special deals and discounts to subscribers, so signing up for their newsletters can help you get the best deal.

## Conclusion

Booking your flight early can help you get the lowest price and save money on other aspects of your trip. The optimal booking window is from 21 days to about 45 days before travel, so if you plan ahead, you can get the best deal.

Follow the tips above to help you find the best deal on your flight. With a little bit of planning and research, you can save money and get the best deal on your next flight.
