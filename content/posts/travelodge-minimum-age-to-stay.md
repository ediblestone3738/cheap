# Travelodge Minimum Age to Stay

When planning a hotel stay, especially if you’re a younger traveller, one of the most important questions is: **“What’s the minimum age to book and stay at Travelodge?”** Learn about the Travelodge Minimum Age below.

Policies can vary between hotels, so it’s essential to understand the rules before you reserve your room. This guide covers the **official Travelodge minimum age requirements**, how they work in practice, and what young travellers should know.

## Booking Age Requirements

The general rule is simple: **You must be at least 18 years old to book and stay at [Travelodge](https://www.travelodge.co.uk/) without a guardian.**

- **18+ years**: You can book and stay in a Travelodge room independently.

- **16–17 years**: You cannot stay alone, but you may stay if accompanied by a responsible adult (18+).

- **Under 16 years**: Must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian; hotels will not allow check-in without an adult.

**Why 18?**  
Hotels set the age at 18 because it’s the legal age of majority in the UK. This ensures the guest is legally responsible for the booking, payments, and any damages.

Related reading: If you’re 18+ and looking to save money on your booking, check out our [Travelodge Prices guide](/cheap-holidays/united-kingdom/travelodge-prices-how-to-save-on-your-next-booking/ "Travelodge Prices: How to Save on Your Next Booking") for strategies to get the best deals.

## Staying with Minors or Guests Under 18

Travelodge welcomes families, but there are clear rules if someone under 18 is part of the booking:

- **Children under 16** stay free when sharing a room with a paying adult, making it a budget-friendly choice for families.

- Rooms typically come with **double beds plus pull-out beds** for kids, so families can share without extra room costs.

- **Proof of age**: If a guest appears under 18, the front desk may ask for photo ID.

Example scenario:

- A 17-year-old travelling with friends (all under 18) will be refused check-in.

- A 17-year-old with a 19-year-old companion will usually be allowed, as the booking is in the adult’s name.

This policy is strictly enforced to ensure child safeguarding and reduce liability for the hotel.

## Exceptions and Hotel-Specific Rules

While Travelodge has a standard policy across the UK, some **exceptions** apply:

- **International locations**: If you’re booking a Travelodge outside the UK (for example in Ireland or Spain), age rules may differ slightly depending on local law. Always check the hotel’s booking conditions.

- **ID requirements**: Some city-centre Travelodges (London, Manchester, Birmingham) may ask for ID for all guests, especially younger travellers, due to security policies.

- **Group bookings**: School trips or youth groups may need to go through Travelodge’s group booking department, where specific adult-to-student ratios are required.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Policies can vary, so always double-check the official Travelodge website or call the hotel directly before booking.

## Tips for Young Travelers Booking Travelodge

If you’re 18–21 and travelling independently, here are some useful tips:

1. **Carry photo ID** – Even if you’re over 18, front desk staff may request ID if you look younger.

1. **Book with a credit/debit card in your name** – This avoids problems at check-in if your parent’s card was used.

1. **Avoid last-minute walk-ins** – Online bookings are easier to verify, and staff may be stricter with age checks for walk-in guests.

1. **Consider Flexible Rate rooms** – If plans change or you face issues at check-in, these can be cancelled without losing your money. (Read our [Travelodge Prices guide](/cheap-holidays/united-kingdom/travelodge-prices-how-to-save-on-your-next-booking/ "Travelodge Prices: How to Save on Your Next Booking") for how Flexible vs Saver rates work.)

1. **Travel with a responsible adult if under 18** – Even if you’re nearly 18, it’s better to avoid the risk of being turned away.

These precautions help avoid disappointment and make your stay smoother.
