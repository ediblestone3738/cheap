Coastal France: A Haven for Holiday Lovers

France has always been a popular tourism destination. It's well known for its stunning architecture, its cuisine, and its culture. However, perhaps one of its most overlooked attractions is its coastline. The French coast is simply breathtaking, with sparkling beaches, picturesque towns, and a unique culture. From the quaint fishing villages of Brittany to the glamour of the French Riviera, French coastal holidays offer something for everyone.

The best time to visit the French coast is between June and September when the weather is warm and sunny, and tourists descend on the region in droves. However, if you prefer a more relaxed atmosphere, we recommend visiting in the off-season, particularly in May and September.

Below, we will take a closer look at some of the best locations for French coastal holidays and discuss what makes each of them unique.

1\. Brittany

Brittany is a dramatic coastal region that forms France's northwest corner. Known for its rugged coastline, windswept beaches, and Celtic heritage, Brittany is an ideal destination for those who are looking for peace and quiet.

Start your journey in the charming town of St-Malo. With its imposing stone walls that date back to the 12th century, St-Malo has a distinctive character that sets it apart from other French coastal towns. Take a walk around the ramparts, explore the local markets, and sample the famous seafood.

Next, head to the famous Pink Granite Coast, a stretch of coastline that gets its name from the distinctive pink hues of its granite cliffs. The coastal path offers some of the most dramatic views in Brittany, with rugged cliffs and hidden coves. Be sure to stop by the pretty town of Ploumanac'h, with its stunning lighthouse and tranquil beach.

2\. Normandy

Normandy is a popular region for lovers of history and literature. With its charming harbors, quaint fishing villages, and extensive sandy beaches, Normandy is the perfect destination for those who want to escape the hustle and bustle of city life.

Start your journey in Deauville, a chic resort town that has been popular with the French elite since the 19th century. Stroll along the promenade and gaze at the elegant mansions and luxury yachts that line the harbor.

Next, head to the town of Honfleur, known for its charming harbor, cobbled streets, and stunning Norman architecture. Honfleur has been inspiring artists and writers since the 19th century, and it's easy to see why.

Finally, visit the D-Day landing beaches, a sobering reminder of one of the most significant events of the 20th century. The beaches are quiet and peaceful now, but they hold a special place in history.

3\. French Riviera

The French Riviera, also known as the Cote d'Azur, is an iconic region that has been attracting visitors for over a century. With its pristine beaches, glamorous resorts, and stunning scenery, the French Riviera is the perfect destination for those who want to indulge in a little luxury.

Begin your journey in Nice, the jewel of the French Riviera. Explore the charming old town, with its narrow streets and colorful buildings. Walk along the famous Promenade des Anglais and enjoy the stunning views of the Mediterranean.

Next, head to the town of Cannes, known for its famous film festival and luxury hotels. Stroll along the Boulevard de la Croisette, with its designer boutiques and chic cafes.

Finally, visit the glitzy town of St-Tropez, where the rich and famous come to play. Wander around the charming old town, take in the stunning views of the bay, and enjoy the vibrant nightlife.
