Is Corsica Very Expensive?

Corsica is a beautiful island located in the Mediterranean Sea, known for its stunning landscapes, crystal-clear waters, and picturesque villages. But when it comes to the cost of traveling or living in Corsica, many people wonder if it's an affordable destination. So, is Corsica very expensive? The answer is not straightforward, as it depends on several factors. In this in-depth travel article, we will explore the costs of living and traveling in Corsica, and provide some tips on how to keep your expenses under control.

Cost of Accommodation in Corsica

The cost of accommodation in Corsica varies depending on the time of year and the location you choose. During the high season, which runs from June to August, prices can be significantly higher than during other times of the year. The most popular areas, such as Calvi, Porto-Vecchio, and Bonifacio, are also the most expensive.

On average, a hotel room in Corsica can cost between €50 to €150 per night, while a private apartment or house can range from €60 to €300 per night. If you're traveling on a budget, you can consider staying in a hostel, which typically costs between €20 to €40 per night. Another affordable option is to camp, and Corsica has many campsites that offer a great location and amenities for a reasonable price. Camping fees can vary but will often be around €10 to €30 per night depending on the location and facilities.

Cost of Food in Corsica

Corsica is known for its exceptional gastronomy, and foodies will be thrilled to try traditional dishes and local products. But the cost of eating out in Corsica can be high, especially in the main tourist areas. A restaurant meal can cost between €20 to €50 per person, depending on the location and the type of cuisine. If you opt for a more upscale restaurant, the cost can go up to €100 per person or more. However, there are cheaper options available, such as fast-food chains and pizza places, which offer meals for around €10 to €15.

If you're on a budget, you can also consider buying groceries and cooking your meals. Supermarkets like Carrefour, Casino, and Spar can be found all over the island, and prices are similar to those in mainland France. For example, a loaf of bread can cost around €1, a liter of milk around €0.85, and a dozen eggs around €2.50.

Cost of Transportation in Corsica

Getting around Corsica can be challenging, especially if you don't have a car. Public transportation is limited and not always reliable, so renting a car is the best option to explore the island. Car rental prices can vary depending on the season, the type of car, and the rental company, but on average, you can expect to pay between €40 to €100 per day.

If you prefer not to drive, you can take a bus, which connects most of the towns and villages on the island. A one-way ticket costs around €5 to €10, but keep in mind that schedules can be irregular, especially during the low season. Another option is to take a taxi, which can be expensive, especially for long distances. A 30-minute ride can cost between €30 to €50, so it's best to negotiate the price beforehand.

Cost of Activities in Corsica

Corsica offers a wide range of activities, such as hiking, swimming, snorkeling, and visiting historical sites. Most beaches, rivers, and natural parks in Corsica are free to access, so you can enjoy them without spending a dime. However, some activities have a cost, such as guided tours, water sports, and entrance fees to museums and monuments.

For example, a boat tour around the island can cost between €40 to €100, depending on the duration and the itinerary. A guided hike in the mountains can cost around €25 to €50 per person, while a 2-hour canoe trip can be around €30 per person.
