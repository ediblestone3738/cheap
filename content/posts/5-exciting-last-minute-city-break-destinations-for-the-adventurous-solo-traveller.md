Solo travel has become increasingly popular in recent years, and there are a plethora of destinations to choose from. However, sometimes you can't plan ahead and need to take a last-minute city break. Don't worry – there are still plenty of exciting options available for the adventurous solo traveller. Here are five destinations that won't disappoint.

Barcelona is a vibrant city with something for everyone. From the bustling streets of Las Ramblas to the colorful buildings of Park Guell, there's so much to see and do. As a solo traveller, you can take advantage of the city's excellent public transportation system to explore at your own pace.

One of the highlights of Barcelona is the food scene. Head to La Boqueria Market to try traditional Spanish tapas or paella. If you're feeling adventurous, try some of the weirder options like pig's ears or snails. Barcelona is also known for its nightlife, so there's always something going on.

2\. Prague, Czech Republic  

Prague is an affordable city with a rich history and stunning architecture. The city is compact, making it easy to explore on foot, and there are plenty of cultural attractions to keep you occupied.

Stroll the cobblestone streets of Old Town to see the famous astronomical clock or visit the stunning Prague Castle. For a unique experience, head to the Sedlec Ossuary, a small chapel decorated with human bones.

Prague is also known for its beer culture. Stop by one of the many beer halls to try some of the local brews and meet new people. The city is especially lovely in the fall and winter, when the Christmas markets add some extra charm.

3\. Reykjavik, Iceland  

If you're looking for something truly unique, Reykjavik is the place for you. The capital of Iceland is a great destination for adventure-seekers, with activities like hiking, glacier climbing, and whale watching.

For something more relaxing, take a dip in the famous Blue Lagoon hot springs or visit the Aurora Reykjavik Northern Lights Center. The city also has a thriving art and music scene, so be sure to check out some local galleries and venues.

4\. Lisbon, Portugal  

Lisbon is a laid-back city with a lot of personality. The city is known for its colorful buildings, charming trams, and delicious food. Start your day with a pastel de nata, Portugal's famous custard tart, and stroll through the hilly streets of the Alfama district.

Head to the Belem district to see the iconic Belem Tower and the Monument to the Discoveries. If you're feeling adventurous, take a day trip to nearby Sintra to explore the fairytale castles and gardens.

5\. Tokyo, Japan  

Tokyo is a bustling city with a blend of traditional and modern culture. As a solo traveller, it's easy to navigate the city using the excellent subway system. There are plenty of museums and temples to visit, as well as world-class shopping and dining.

One of the best things about Tokyo is the street food scene. Try some of the local specialties like ramen, yakitori, or sushi. For a unique experience, visit a cat or owl cafe, where you can interact with the animals while enjoying a cup of tea.
