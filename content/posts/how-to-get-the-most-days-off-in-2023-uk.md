# How to Get the Most Days Off in 2023 UK

With the right planning, UK workers can get up to 48 days off work in 2023 using just 19 days of their annual leave. By strategically scheduling their holidays around the UK’s Bank Holidays, workers can maximize their time away and enjoy a well-deserved break.

## Step 1: Plan Around Easter

The first step to getting the most days off in 2023 is to plan around Easter. Easter falls on Sunday 16 April 2023, with the Bank Holiday on Monday 17 April. If you take two days of annual leave either side of the Bank Holiday, you can enjoy a five-day break from Friday 14 April to Tuesday 18 April.

## Step 2: Plan Around Christmas and New Year

The second step is to plan around Christmas and New Year. Christmas Day falls on Sunday 25 December 2023, with the Bank Holiday on Monday 26 December. If you take two days of annual leave either side of the Bank Holiday, you can enjoy a five-day break from Friday 22 December to Tuesday 26 December.

New Year’s Day falls on Sunday 1 January 2024, with the Bank Holiday on Monday 2 January. If you take two days of annual leave either side of the Bank Holiday, you can enjoy a five-day break from Friday 29 December 2023 to Tuesday 2 January 2024.

## Step 3: Plan Around the Summer Bank Holidays

The third step is to plan around the summer Bank Holidays. The first Bank Holiday falls on Monday 1 May 2023, with the second Bank Holiday falling on Monday 28 August 2023. If you take two days of annual leave either side of the Bank Holidays, you can enjoy a five-day break from Friday 28 April to Tuesday 2 May, and from Friday 25 August to Tuesday 29 August.

## Step 4: Schedule Annual Leave Around Other Bank Holidays

The fourth step is to schedule annual leave around other Bank Holidays. The other Bank Holidays in 2023 are:

• Monday 7 May
• Monday 4 June
• Monday 27 August
• Monday 26 December

If you take two days of annual leave either side of these Bank Holidays, you can enjoy a five-day break.

## Step 5: Add Up Your Days Off

The fifth and final step is to add up your days off. By following the steps above, you can enjoy up to 48 days off work in 2023 using just 19 days of your annual leave.

## Conclusion

By planning carefully around the UK’s Bank Holidays, workers can get the most days off in 2023. By taking two days of annual leave either side of the Bank Holidays, workers can enjoy up to 48 days off work in 2023 using just 19 days of their annual leave.
