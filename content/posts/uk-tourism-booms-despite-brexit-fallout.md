UK Tourism Booms Despite Brexit Fallout

Brexit is a political issue that has had a major impact on the UK and the world. However, the UK tourism sector is thriving, despite the challenges posed by Brexit. The UK is known for its rich cultural heritage, scenic beauty, and historical landmarks, which has made it a popular tourist destination amongst those who want to explore the beauty of Europe.

The UK tourism industry is an essential part of the UK economy, providing employment for over 3.1 million people and generating more than £126 billion of revenue in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Despite Brexit-related uncertainties and travel restrictions related to the pandemic, there has been a surge in tourism in the UK as people are eager to explore the beauty of this country.

In this article, we will look at the reasons behind the UK tourism boom despite Brexit fallout, its impact on the economy, and top tourist destinations in the country.

Why Is UK Tourism Booming Despite Brexit Fallout?

1\. Weak Pound: Since the announcement of Brexit, the value of the pound has fallen against other currencies, making it cheaper for foreign tourists to visit the UK. This has made the UK an affordable destination for tourists from other countries.

2\. Staycations: The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has led to a rise in “staycations” as people are hesitant to travel abroad due to the dangers of contracting the virus. This has led to many Britons exploring their own country rather than going abroad for their holidays.

3\. Culture and Heritage: The UK has a rich cultural heritage that attracts tourists from all over the world. From the historic castles, famous museums, and galleries to the bustling cities and scenic countryside, the UK has something for everyone.

4\. Travel Connections: The UK has excellent transport connections, including airports, train stations, and bus services, making it easy for tourists to travel around the country. The availability of good transport connections has led to the growth of day trips and weekend breaks.

5\. Diverse Experiences: The UK is home to a range of tourist attractions, from historic landmarks to vibrant cities, coastal towns, and national parks. This means that tourists have a choice of experiences, and they can pick an experience that suits their interests and preferences.

Impact of UK Tourism on the Economy

The tourism industry is a significant contributor to the UK economy, and its growth has a positive impact on various sectors. According to VisitBritain, the tourism industry created 60,000 jobs in the UK between 2017 and 2018. This sector generates more revenue than the automotive industry, life sciences, aerospace, and the creative industry combined. Furthermore, the industry's growth has a domino effect on other industries, boosting the retail sector, the food and drink industry, and hospitality.
