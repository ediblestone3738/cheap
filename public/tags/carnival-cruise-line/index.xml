Carnival Cruise Line stands out as a significant player in this sector, known for its engaging atmosphere and diverse itineraries. Established in 1972, Carnival started with the Mardi Gras, a vessel that blazed the trail for fun at sea. Over the years, the fleet has expanded to encompass over 20 ships, each designed to offer a unique blend of leisure and adventure. The company has always prioritized creating memorable experiences, promoting the idea of cruising as the “fun ship” experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
