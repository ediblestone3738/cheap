NCL was established in 1966, pioneering the concept of freestyle cruising. The company has evolved significantly over the decades, adapting to modern travel trends while maintaining an exceptional commitment to service. One of the hallmarks of NCL&amp;rsquo;s ethos is its appreciation for those who serve in the armed forces. Recognizing the sacrifices made by military personnel and their families, the company has introduced various military discounts, making it more accessible for these individuals to enjoy a well-deserved vacation on the open seas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
