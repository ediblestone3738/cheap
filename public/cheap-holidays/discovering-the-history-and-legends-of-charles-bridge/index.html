<p>History of Charles Bridge</p>
<p>The Charles Bridge was built during the reign of Charles IV, the Holy Roman Emperor in 1357. This bridge was built to replace the old Judith Bridge that was destroyed during the floods in 1342. The construction of this new bridge was an ambitious undertaking and took more than 50 years to complete. The bridge is made of sandstone blocks and features a Gothic architecture style that is typical of the 14th century.</p>
<p>During its construction, Charles Bridge served not just as a bridge, but also as a symbol of power and wealth of the Czech Kingdom. The bridge was used for religious processions and royal parades, and it was adorned with religious statues that were believed to protect the bridge and the citizens of Prague.</p>

It is said that this saint was a confessor to the queen and refused to reveal the queen&rsquo;s secrets to the king. As punishment, he was thrown into the Vltava River from the Charles Bridge. His body was later found, and his remains were collected by the citizens of Prague. The statue of St. John of Nepomuk was erected on the Charles Bridge where he was thrown into the river. It is believed that touching the statue brings good luck and that rubbing the plaque beneath brings prosperity.</p>
