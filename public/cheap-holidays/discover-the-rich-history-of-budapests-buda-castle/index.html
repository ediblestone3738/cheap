Budapest&rsquo;s Buda Castle is a remarkable destination that offers visitors a chance to explore the rich history of Hungary. The castle, often referred to as the Royal Palace or the Budapest Castle, is a complex of buildings situated on a hill overlooking the city of Budapest. An incredibly popular attraction, the palace is known for its impressive architecture, stunning views, and interesting history dating back to the 13th century. In this article, we will delve deep into the history of Buda Castle, explore the top five tourist attractions located on the palace grounds, and answer some commonly asked questions.</p>
<p>History of Buda Castle</p>
<p>The construction of Buda Castle dates back to the 13th century when it was built as a fortress by King Bela IV. The castle initially served as a defense against Mongol invasions in the 13th century but later became the residence of the Hungarian kings. The castle has been destroyed and rebuilt several times over the centuries due to various invasions, wars, and fires. However, each time it was rebuilt, its architecture became more ornate and grandiose than the prior versions.</p>
<p>In the 16th century, the Ottoman Turks occupied Budapest and the palace was converted into a Turkish bathhouse. It was not until the late 17th and early 18th centuries that the palace was reconstructed in the Baroque style by the Habsburg dynasty, who then used it as a royal residence. Additionally, in the 19th century, the palace was rebuilt once again, this time in the Gothic style, and the layout of the entire complex was modified to better suit the needs of the Habsburgs.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, Buda Castle had a tumultuous series of events during the Second World War. The Nazi regime occupied the palace during the war and, during the Siege of Budapest, both the palace and the surrounding area were heavily bombed. After the war, the government of Hungary began a massive restoration effort to repair the damage. In 1987, Buda Castle and the surrounding area were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>Top Five Tourist Attractions in Buda Castle</p>

It is most famous for its colorful tiled roof and beautiful interior. The church has been used for coronations and royal weddings throughout history.</p>
<p>3. The Fisherman&rsquo;s Bastion: This beautiful terrace offers some of the most stunning views of Budapest. It was named after the fishermen who once defended this part of the castle walls from invaders. The bastion offers a panoramic view of the city and the Danube River, making it a popular spot for photographers.</p>
<p>4. The Budapest History Museum: Located inside the palace, this museum offers a fascinating insight into the history of Budapest. The museum has a vast collection of artifacts ranging from Roman times to the present day, including clothing, weapons, and everyday items from different periods of history.</p>
