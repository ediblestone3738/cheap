<p>1. Top Beaches in Corsica</p>
<p>There are plenty of beautiful beaches to explore in Corsica, but here are just a few of the top-rated destinations:</p>
<p>Palombaggia Beach - Located on the southern end of the island, Palombaggia Beach is widely considered one of the best beaches in Corsica. This white, sandy beach is backed by rugged, pine-covered hills and boasts crystal-clear waters.</p>
<p>Santa Giulia Beach - Another southern beach, Santa Giulia features soft white sand, turquoise water, and a lagoon that&rsquo;s ideal for swimming. The beach is popular with families, with plenty of beachside cafes and restaurants.</p>
<p>Loto Beach - Situated on the western coast of Corsica, Loto Beach is a remote, secluded spot that&rsquo;s perfect for those looking for a quiet beach experience. The crescent-shaped beach is surrounded by steep cliffs and features a dense forest behind it.</p>
<p>Rondinara Beach - This beach is often compared to Palombaggia and is located on the southeast coast of Corsica. Rondinara Beach boasts a stunning shell-shaped bay with crystal-clear water and soft, powdery sand.</p>
<p>Saleccia Beach - Located in the Agriates desert, Saleccia Beach is accessible only by foot, boat, or four-wheel drive. This secluded beach features pristine, white sand that&rsquo;s perfect for sunbathing, and the surrounding scrublands provide plenty of opportunities for hiking and exploring.</p>
<p>2. FAQ About Corsica&rsquo;s Beaches:</p>
<p>Q: When is the best time to visit Corsica for a beach holiday?</p>
<p>A: The best time to visit Corsica for a beach holiday is from June to September when the weather is warm and dry. July and August are peak tourism months when the beaches are crowded, and accommodation prices are high.</p>
