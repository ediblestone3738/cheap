<p>The Mediterranean Coast</p>
<p>The Mediterranean coast remains the most popular region for beach holidays in France, especially for those who seek a luxurious experience.

It&rsquo;s a rugged yet splendidly beautiful island with colourful hilltop villages, dense forests, and a tremendous coastline that offers a mix of secluded bays and bustling resorts. Ajaccio, the birthplace of the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, is the island&rsquo;s capital and main city, with a lively port and a long, elegant seafront.</p>
<p>Brittany</p>
<p>Brittany, a region in the northwest of France, offers a coastline that is rugged and wild, with rocky cliffs, rolling waves, and charming fishing villages. The panoramic views of the sea and its landscape can be admired from the many walking trails, biking routes, or lighthouses. Saint-Malo, a walled city dating back to the Middle Ages, is Brittany&rsquo;s most popular destination with its bustling port, stunning beach, and rich history. Brest, the second-largest city in Brittany, is an attractive harbour town with a long maritime history, numerous cultural venues and a selection of seafood restaurants.</p>
