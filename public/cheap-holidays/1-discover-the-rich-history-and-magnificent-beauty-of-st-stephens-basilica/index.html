Discover the Rich History and Magnificent Beauty of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Basilica</p>
<p>St. Stephen&rsquo;s Basilica is one of the most iconic landmarks of Budapest, Hungary. This beautiful neoclassical church is named in honor of the country&rsquo;s first king, St. Stephen, who founded the Hungarian state and brought Christianity to the region.

<p>History of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Basilica</p>

The church was named after St. Stephen, who was canonized in 1083 and is revered as a national hero in Hungary.</p>
<p>St. Stephen&rsquo;s Basilica is the largest church in Budapest, with a seating capacity of over 8,000 people. It was also the tallest building in Hungary until the completion of the Hungarian Parliament in 1902. The basilica was damaged during World War II, but it was rebuilt in the postwar period and has since become a major tourist attraction in Budapest.</p>
