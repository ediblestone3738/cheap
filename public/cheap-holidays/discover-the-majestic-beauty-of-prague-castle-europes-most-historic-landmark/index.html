Discover the Majestic Beauty of Prague Castle: Europe&rsquo;s Most Historic Landmark</p>
<p>Perched atop a hill overlooking the city of Prague, the Prague Castle is Europe&rsquo;s largest ancient castle, deemed an exemplary landmark of Czech history and culture. The splendor of the castle is irresistible, and to see its grandeur is a must for anyone who wants to feel the spirit of the Czech Republic. Discover the majestic beauty of Prague Castle, Europe&rsquo;s most historic landmark, as it offers a glimpse into the vivid history of the city and the complexities of its culture.</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>The immense history surrounding the Prague Castle dates back to the 9th century when it was established as an essential fortress. Later, it became the residence of Czech kings and eventually the seat of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 20th century, it played a significant role in the Czechoslovak political scene and served as the home of Presidents. Today, it stands as a national treasure, containing within its walls a vast array of structures such as Gothic cathedrals, Renaissance palaces, and Baroque gardens, symbolizing the rich past, traditions, and culture of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Discovering the Castle</p>
<p>The Prague Castle is surrounded by a deep moat and a thirteen-meter high wall, adding grandeur to its architecture. The castle grounds showcase broad courtyards where you can explore exceptional architectural masterpieces. This fabulous castle measures roughly 70,000 square meters - roughly the size of seven rugby fields. Touring the castle takes a day or two, but the adventures and the experience are worth every minute.</p>
<p>As you experience the grandness of the castle, take a moment to explore the surrounding areas. Start at the St. Vitus Cathedral, built between 1344 and the 20th century, showcasing a unique mixture of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque style architectures. The cathedral houses the relics of saints and kings of medieval Bohemia, and climbing to the top of the cathedral&rsquo;s tower offers a breathtaking view of the city.</p>
<p>Next, take a leisurely stroll down the Golden Lane, a street crammed with tiny, colorful, picturesque houses. The Golden Lane takes its name from the goldsmiths that once inhabited these quarters in the 16th century.</p>
<p>At the eastern edge of the castle grounds, you will find the palace gardens. The garden is a luxuriant and romantic setting displaying roses, peonies, and an array of exotic flowers, showcasing intricate water fountains running into rock-pools lined with fish.</p>
<p>The Castle Tour</p>
<p>There are several ways you can go about touring the castle. You can opt for the standard guided tour to take you to the main highlights. But, to make the most out of your exploring experience, get a Prague Castle Short-Term Ticket. This ticket gets you through the impressive history museum, the Picture Gallery, and the exhibitions devoted to the Czech Art Nouveau.</p>
<p>You can also choose a more unconfined route where you will follow your interests and enjoy the scenery without being confined to a tour guide. However, you should consider downloading audio tours and exploring with a detailed guidebook.</p>
