Exploring the USS Midway: A Journey Through Naval History</p>
<p>The USS Midway, an aircraft carrier that served in the U.S. Navy from 1945 to 1992, is now a museum dedicated to educating visitors about naval history. The museum is located in downtown San Diego and attracts over a million visitors each year. A visit to the USS Midway is not just a stroll through a museum, but an immersive experience that takes visitors through the ship&rsquo;s history and provides insight into the lives of the sailors who served on it.</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>The USS Midway was commissioned in 1945, just after World War II. It was the largest ship in the world at the time, with a length of 1,001 feet and a crew of over 4,000 sailors. It saw action during the Vietnam War and the Persian Gulf War and was decommissioned in 1992. After several years in storage, it was opened to the public as a museum in 2004.</p>
<p>Exhibits</p>
<p>The USS Midway Museum features over 60 exhibits that showcase the ship&rsquo;s history and life onboard.

<p>Visitors can also tour the ship&rsquo;s medical facilities and learn about the Navy&rsquo;s medical procedures and practices. The museum features a recreated sickbay, which shows the ship&rsquo;s medical facilities as they were during the Vietnam War.</p>
