Discover the History and Charm of Fisherman&rsquo;s Bastion</p>
<p>Fisherman&rsquo;s Bastion is perched on a hill overlooking the Danube River in Budapest, Hungary.

This article will take you on a journey through the history, architecture and charm of Fisherman&rsquo;s Bastion.</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>Fisherman&rsquo;s Bastion was built between 1895 and 1902 as a celebration of the 1000th anniversary of the Hungarian state. The original structure was built in the 13th century as part of the Buda Castle walls, but it was mostly destroyed during the Ottoman occupation of Hungary. The current structure was designed by Frigyes Schulek and was built on the foundation of the former walls. The name of the Bastion comes from the fact that it was guarded by the fishermen&rsquo;s guild, who were responsible for defending this part of the city.</p>
<p>Architecture</p>
<p>Fisherman&rsquo;s Bastion is a neo-Gothic and neo-Romanesque style structure with seven turrets and two staircases. The turrets represent the seven Hungarian tribes that founded the country, while the staircases symbolize the division of Buda and Pest. The whole structure is made of stone, and the turrets and arches are adorned with ornate carvings and statues.</p>
