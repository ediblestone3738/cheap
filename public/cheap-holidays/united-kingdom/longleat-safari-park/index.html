<h3 id="the-enchanting-history-of-longleat-safari-park">The Enchanting History of Longleat Safari Park</h3>
<p>Nestled in the picturesque Wiltshire countryside, Longleat Safari Park is steeped in a fascinating history that dates back to the Elizabethan era. Originally the stately home of the Thynn family, Longleat House was completed in 1580 and is often hailed as one of the finest examples of Elizabethan architecture. The estate’s transformation into a safari park in 1966 was a revolutionary concept for its time, marking a departure from traditional zoos and paving the way for a new model of animal conservation and public engagement.</p>
<p>Inspired by his travels to Africa, Ceawlin Thynn, the 7th Marquess of Bath, introduced the idea of an African safari experience in the UK. The park opened with just a few exotic species, including lions and tigers, and quickly gained popularity. Today, it spans over 900 acres and features more than 150 species of animals, offering visitors an opportunity to experience a bit of the savannah without ever stepping foot outside England.</p>

Upon arriving, a short taxi ride or a local bus will take you directly to the park.</p>
