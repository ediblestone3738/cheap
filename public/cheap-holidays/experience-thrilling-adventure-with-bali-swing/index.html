<p>Bali Swing: What to Expect</p>
<p>Bali Swing is an eco-friendly attraction located in a lush jungle valley in Ubud, Bali. As soon as you arrive, you will be greeted by friendly staff who will present you with a menu of thrilling activities, including the giant swing, bird’s nest, flying fox, and many more. Once you have decided on which activity to engage in, the staff will guide you through the safety measures and give you a helmet and a harness.</p>
<p>The giant swing is undoubtedly the most popular activity, and it’s not hard to see why.

You can sit inside the nest and enjoy a bird’s eye view of the breathtaking scenery around you, including the river, rice paddies, and lush green jungle.</p>
<p>Another popular attraction is the flying fox or zip line. You will be attached to a pulley and sent soaring across the valley, feeling the wind in your hair and the thrill of the ride.
