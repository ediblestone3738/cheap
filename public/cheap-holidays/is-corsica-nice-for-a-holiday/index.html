The stunning views of the island&rsquo;s rugged terrain make the challenge worthwhile.</p>
<p>For beach lovers, Corsica&rsquo;s 1,000km coastline boasts some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe. The island&rsquo;s southern coast has several secluded beaches such as Roccapina and Palombaggia, while the northern coast has long sandy beaches such as Saleccia and Loto. The crystal-clear waters of Corsica&rsquo;s beaches are perfect for snorkeling, diving, and other water sports.</p>
<p>Culture enthusiasts will appreciate Corsica&rsquo;s rich history and culture. The island has a strong nationalist identity, and the locals are proud of their unique language and traditions. Visitors can explore Corsica&rsquo;s historic towns, such as Calvi, with its citadel and stunning views over the sea.
