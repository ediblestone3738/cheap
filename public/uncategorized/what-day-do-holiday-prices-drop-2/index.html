                        <h1 id="what-day-do-holiday-prices-drop">What Day Do Holiday Prices Drop?</h1>
<p>As a travel expert, I&rsquo;m often asked what day of the week is best to book a package holiday. While it&rsquo;s true that prices can fluctuate, there is one day in particular that can offer the best deals. That day is Monday.</p>
<p>It turns out that many travel companies, including Thomas Cook, offer their best deals on a Monday. This is because they often drop prices in an effort to entice customers who may have received a quote over the weekend, but not completed a booking.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re looking to get the best deal on a package holiday, then Monday is the day to book. You may be able to save yourself some money by booking on this day, so it&rsquo;s definitely worth considering.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-prices-drop-on-monday">Why Do Prices Drop on Monday?</h2>
<p>The reason why prices drop on Monday is that travel companies are trying to encourage customers to book their holidays. By offering lower prices on a Monday, they are hoping to entice customers who may have been considering a holiday, but haven&rsquo;t yet committed to booking.</p>
<p>This is also a great way for travel companies to fill up their packages quickly. By offering lower prices on a Monday, they can fill up their packages more quickly, which helps them to make more money.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-getting-the-best-deals">Tips for Getting the Best Deals</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to get the best deal on a package holiday, then there are a few tips that you should keep in mind. Firstly, make sure to book your holiday on a Monday. This is when you&rsquo;re likely to get the best deals.</p>
<p>Secondly, make sure to shop around. Different travel companies may offer different deals, so it&rsquo;s worth comparing prices before you book.</p>
<p>Thirdly, be flexible with your dates. If you&rsquo;re willing to travel at different times of the year, then you may be able to get a better deal.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure to sign up for newsletters and follow travel companies on social media. This way, you&rsquo;ll be the first to know about any special offers or discounts that they may be offering.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to get the best deal on a package holiday, then Monday is the day to book. Many travel companies, including Thomas Cook, offer their best deals on a Monday. This is because they often drop prices in an effort to entice customers who may have received a quote over the weekend, but not completed a booking.</p>
<p>In addition to booking on a Monday, there are a few other tips that you should keep in mind. Make sure to shop around, be flexible with your dates, and sign up for newsletters and follow travel companies on social media. This way, you&rsquo;ll be sure to get the best deal on your package holiday.</p>
