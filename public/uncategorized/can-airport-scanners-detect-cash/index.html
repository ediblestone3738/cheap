If you are carrying more than $10,000 in cash, you must declare it to the authorities. It is also important to note that different countries have different rules when it comes to carrying cash on a plane.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-if-cash-is-detected-by-an-airport-scanner">What Happens if Cash is Detected by an Airport Scanner?</h2>

Depending on the amount of cash detected, the authorities may ask you to provide proof of where the money came from. If you are unable to provide proof, the authorities may confiscate the money.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
