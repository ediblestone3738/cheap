                        <h1 id="is-booking-through-a-travel-agent-cheaper">Is Booking Through a Travel Agent Cheaper?</h1>
<p>When it comes to booking travel, there are many options available to travelers. From online booking sites to working with a travel agent, it can be difficult to decide which route to take. While booking online can be convenient, there are many benefits to working with a travel agent. According to travel expert Ashley Seaton, booking through a travel agent typically won&rsquo;t cost you more.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-working-with-a-travel-agent">The Benefits of Working with a Travel Agent</h2>
<p>When you work with a travel agent, you get the benefit of their expertise and knowledge. They can help you find the best deals, the most convenient flights, and the best accommodations for your budget. Travel agents also have access to special deals and discounts that you won&rsquo;t find online. They can also help you with all the paperwork and documentation you need for your trip.</p>
<h2 id="will-it-cost-more">Will It Cost More?</h2>
<p>According to Seaton, while some agents will charge you a nominal planning fee, many agencies like hers do not charge anything extra for their services. &ldquo;We get paid a commission on the back end from the vendor, so that&rsquo;s how we make our income,&rdquo; she said. This means that booking through a travel agent won&rsquo;t cost you any more than booking online.</p>
<h2 id="do-your-research">Do Your Research</h2>
<p>When it comes to finding the right travel agent, it&rsquo;s important to do your research. Look for an agent who specializes in the type of travel you&rsquo;re looking for. Ask for recommendations from friends and family who have used a travel agent in the past. Read reviews online to get an idea of the quality of service the agent provides.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Booking through a travel agent can be a great way to save time and money. With their expertise and access to special deals, you can get the best deals and the most convenient flights and accommodations. While some agents may charge a nominal fee, many do not. So, if you&rsquo;re looking for a convenient and cost-effective way to book your next trip, consider working with a travel agent.</p>
