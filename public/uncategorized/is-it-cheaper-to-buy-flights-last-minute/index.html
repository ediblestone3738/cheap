<h2 id="why-its-not-cheaper-to-buy-flights-last-minute">Why It’s Not Cheaper to Buy Flights Last Minute</h2>
<p>When airlines are looking to fill up their flights, they will sometimes offer discounted fares to entice travelers to book. But these discounted fares are usually only available for a limited time and usually require travelers to book several weeks in advance. Last minute flights are rarely discounted.</p>
<p>The reason why airlines don’t offer discounted fares for last minute flights is because they want to maximize their profits. Airlines know that last minute travelers are often desperate to get to their destination and are willing to pay more for the convenience of booking last minute. So, airlines will often charge more for last minute flights than they would for flights booked several weeks in advance.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-last-minute-flight-deals">How to Find Last Minute Flight Deals</h2>
<p>Although it’s not usually cheaper to buy flights last minute, there are still ways to find last minute flight deals. The key is to be flexible with your travel dates and destinations.</p>
<p>The best way to find last minute flight deals is to use a flight search engine. These search engines allow you to search for flights by destination, date, and price. You can also use filters to narrow down your search results. For example, you can filter your search results by airline, departure time, and number of stops.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a flight that meets your criteria, you can compare the price with other flights to make sure you’re getting the best deal. You can also sign up for flight alerts so you’ll be notified when the price of a flight drops.</p>
