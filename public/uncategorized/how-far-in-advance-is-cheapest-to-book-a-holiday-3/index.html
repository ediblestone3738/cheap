<p>When it comes to booking a holiday, the old adage ‘the early bird catches the worm’ is certainly true. By booking your holiday far in advance you will get the most competitive prices and may even be able to benefit from some early booking incentives, such as a free luggage allowance or room upgrade. But how far in advance is cheapest to book a holiday?</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-booking-early">Benefits of Booking Early</h2>
<p>Booking your holiday early has many benefits. Not only will you get the best prices, but you will also have the pick of the best hotels and flights. If you are looking for a specific hotel or flight, booking early will give you the best chance of securing it. You will also have the peace of mind of knowing that your holiday is booked and you don’t have to worry about availability.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-the-best-time-to-book">When is the Best Time to Book?</h2>
<p>The best <a href="http://localhost:1313/uncategorized/whats-the-cheapest-time-to-book-a-holiday/" title="What’s the cheapest time to book a holiday?">time to book a holiday</a> depends on where you are going and when you want to travel. Generally speaking, if you are looking for the best prices, you should be searching approximately 9 months in advance. For example, if you are looking to book a holiday for 11 November 2022, you should be looking for deals in February 2021.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-last-minute-deals">What About Last Minute Deals?</h2>
<p>It is true that there are some great last minute deals available, but these are usually for destinations that are not in high demand. If you are looking for a popular destination, such as the Caribbean or Europe, then you will not find the same level of discounts as you would if you booked in advance.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-look-for-deals">Where to Look for Deals</h2>
<p>When it comes to finding the best deals, the internet is your best friend. There are many websites that offer discounted holidays, such as Expedia, Travelocity and Lastminute.com. It is also worth checking out the websites of the airlines and hotels directly, as they often have exclusive deals that you won’t find anywhere else.</p>
