    <meta name="description" content="Will TUI Shops Match Online Prices?
As a travel expert, I&rsquo;m often asked if TUI shops will match online prices. The answer is yes! TUI, one of the world&rsquo;s leading travel companies, has a value guarantee that applies to all of their excursions. If a guest receives the exact same excursion from another provider at a better price, TUI will refund the difference between the two offers. This value guarantee applies regardless of whether the customer has booked the excursion in advance at a travel agency, with a local rep or online.">
