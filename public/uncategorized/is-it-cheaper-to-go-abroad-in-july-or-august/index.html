                        <h1 id="is-it-cheaper-to-go-abroad-in-july-or-august">Is it Cheaper to Go Abroad in July or August?</h1>
<p>The summer months are a popular time for many people to go abroad and take a break from the everyday. However, if you’re looking to save money on your trip, it’s important to consider when you travel. Is it cheaper to go abroad in July or August?</p>
<h2 id="travel-in-shoulder-season-to-cut-costs">Travel in ‘Shoulder’ Season to Cut Costs</h2>
<p>The best prices for flights and accommodation can usually be found between March and April or September and October, when the tourist season is at its lowest. This is known as the ‘shoulder’ season, and is the best time to travel if you’re looking to save money.</p>
<p>However, if you’re looking to travel in the summer months, there are still deals to be had before the school holidays begin in July. Travelling in June, rather than July and August, could slash your flight price by more than a third.</p>
<h2 id="compare-prices-to-find-the-best-deals">Compare Prices to Find the Best Deals</h2>
<p>It’s important to compare prices when looking for the best deals. Use websites such as Skyscanner or Kayak to compare flight prices and find the best deals. You can also compare prices on accommodation websites such as Booking.com or Airbnb.</p>
<p>It’s also worth checking out last-minute deals, as airlines and hotels often reduce prices to fill empty seats and rooms. Keep an eye out for special offers and discounts, and don’t be afraid to haggle.</p>
<h2 id="consider-other-costs">Consider Other Costs</h2>
<p>When deciding when to travel, it’s important to consider other costs such as food, transport and activities. Eating out in popular tourist spots can be expensive, so consider eating in local restaurants or self-catering.</p>
<p>You should also consider the cost of transport. Public transport can be expensive in some countries, so consider renting a car or using ride-sharing apps such as Uber or Lyft.</p>
<h2 id="travel-during-off-peak-times">Travel During Off-Peak Times</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to save money on your trip, it’s best to travel during off-peak times. Avoid travelling during peak season, when prices are at their highest. Instead, try to travel during the shoulder season or during the week, when prices are usually lower.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s possible to save money on your trip if you’re willing to travel during the shoulder season or during the week. Compare prices on flights and accommodation, and look out for last-minute deals and discounts. Consider other costs such as food, transport and activities, and try to travel during off-peak times.</p>
