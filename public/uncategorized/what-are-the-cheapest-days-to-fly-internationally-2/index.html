<p>Are you planning an international trip and looking for the best deals? If so, you’re in luck! According to Hopper economist Hayley Berg, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the most inexpensive days to travel internationally. Berg also notes that Wednesday tends to be the cheapest for domestic travel.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple: “The days that other people are less likely to want to travel are always going to be the cheapest days,” Berg says. So if you’re looking to save some money on your next international flight, consider booking your tickets for a Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-the-cheapest-days-to-fly-internationally">How to Find the Cheapest Days to Fly Internationally</h2>
<p>When it comes to finding the cheapest days to fly internationally, there are a few things you can do to make sure you get the best deal.</p>
<p>First, make sure to compare prices across different airlines. Different airlines may offer different prices for the same route, so it’s important to shop around.</p>
<p>Second, consider booking your flight in advance. Airlines often offer discounts for flights booked weeks or even months in advance.</p>
<p>Third, be flexible with your travel dates. If you’re able to be flexible with your travel dates, you may be able to find a cheaper flight. For example, if you’re planning to fly from New York to London, you may be able to find a cheaper flight if you’re willing to fly on a Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<p>Finally, consider using a flight search engine. Flight search engines like Skyscanner or Google Flights can help you compare prices across different airlines and find the best deals.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-saving-money-on-international-flights">Tips for Saving Money on International Flights</h2>
<p>In addition to booking your flight on the cheapest days, there are a few other tips you can use to save money on international flights.</p>
<p>First, consider flying during off-peak times. Flying during off-peak times, such as early morning or late night flights, can help you save money.</p>
<p>Second, consider flying with a budget airline. Budget airlines often offer cheaper fares than traditional airlines, so they’re worth considering if you’re looking to save money.</p>
<p>Third, consider using a rewards program. Many airlines offer rewards programs that allow you to earn points or miles for each flight you take. These points or miles can then be used to get discounts on future flights.</p>
<p>Finally, consider using a credit card that offers travel rewards. Many credit cards offer rewards such as free flights or discounts on flights.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to save money on your next international flight, consider booking your tickets for a Tuesday or Wednesday. Additionally, make sure to compare prices across different airlines, book your flight in advance, be flexible with your travel dates, and consider using a flight search engine. Finally, consider flying during off-peak times, flying with a budget airline, using a rewards program, and using a credit card that offers travel rewards.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you’ll be sure to find the best deals on your next international flight. Happy travels!</p>
