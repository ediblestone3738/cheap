<h2 id="why-do-hotel-prices-go-down">Why Do Hotel Prices Go Down?</h2>
<p>Hotel prices go down the longer you wait because hotels want to fill their rooms. If a hotel has a lot of empty rooms, they are more likely to lower their prices in order to attract more customers. This is especially true for hotels that are located in tourist destinations, where there is a lot of competition.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-take-advantage-of-lower-prices">How Can You Take Advantage of Lower Prices?</h2>
<p>If you are looking to take advantage of lower hotel prices, there are a few things you can do. First, you should book your hotel as far in advance as possible. This will give you the best chance of getting the lowest price.</p>
<p>Second, you should keep an eye on hotel prices. If you notice that the price of a hotel is dropping, you should book it right away. This will ensure that you get the best deal.</p>
<p>Finally, you should consider using a hotel booking app such as HotelTonight. This app allows you to book same-day hotel rooms at a discounted rate.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-finding-the-best-deals">Tips for Finding the Best Deals</h2>
