<p>Are you looking for a great deal on a hotel room? If so, you’re in luck! It turns out that the best time to book a hotel room is right before check-in time. Waiting until the very last minute to book can really pay off. While airfares tend to rise as your travel date approaches, it’s the opposite with hotel prices.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-hotel-prices-cheapest-at-the-last-minute">Why Are Hotel Prices Cheapest at the Last Minute?</h2>
<p>Hotel prices are cheapest at the last minute because hotels don’t want to leave any rooms empty. Empty rooms mean lost revenue for the hotel, so they’re willing to offer deep discounts to fill them up. Hotels also use dynamic pricing, which means that prices can change based on supply and demand. So if a hotel is expecting a lot of guests, they may raise their prices. But if they’re expecting fewer guests, they may lower their prices to attract more people.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-the-best-time-to-book-a-hotel-room">When Is the Best Time to Book a Hotel Room?</h2>
<p>The best time to book a hotel room is right before check-in time, usually around 4 p.m. That’s when hotels start to realize how many rooms they have left and how many guests they’re expecting. If they have a lot of empty rooms, they’ll start offering discounts to fill them up.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-finding-the-best-last-minute-hotel-deals">Tips for Finding the Best Last-Minute Hotel Deals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Book at least 24 hours in advance. Hotels usually offer the best deals at least 24 hours before check-in time.</li>
