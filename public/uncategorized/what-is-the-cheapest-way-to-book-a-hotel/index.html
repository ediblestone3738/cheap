<h2 id="9-look-for-package-deals">9. Look For Package Deals</h2>
<p>Many hotels offer package deals that include flights, car rentals, and other services. These packages can be cheaper than booking everything separately, so it’s worth looking for package deals when booking your hotel.</p>
<h2 id="10-look-for-discounts-for-longer-stays">10. Look For Discounts For Longer Stays</h2>
<p>Many hotels offer discounts for longer stays. If you’re planning to stay for more than a few days, it’s worth looking for discounts for longer stays.</p>
