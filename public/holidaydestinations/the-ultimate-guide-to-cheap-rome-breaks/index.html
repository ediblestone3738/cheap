Rome is a city that has a lot to offer to its visitors. From ancient ruins, stunning architecture, and art to delicious food and wine, there is something for everyone in this city. Unfortunately, Rome can be an expensive destination, and if you&rsquo;re on a budget, it can be challenging to enjoy everything the city has to offer. However, with a little planning, you can have a cheap Rome break without missing out on any of the city&rsquo;s highlights.</p>
<p>In this ultimate guide to cheap Rome breaks, we have put together some practical tips and tricks to help you make the most of your time in this beautiful city without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Getting to Rome</p>
<p>The best time to travel to Rome on a budget is during the low season (November-February). Flights tend to be cheaper, and there are fewer crowds. However, if you can only travel during the high season (May-September), then try to book your flight a few months in advance to get the best deal.</p>
<p>There are several budget airlines that fly to Rome from major European cities, including Ryanair and EasyJet. If you&rsquo;re coming from further afield, consider flying with a more substantial airline and booking your ticket well in advance.</p>
<p>Accommodation in Rome</p>
<p>Accommodation in Rome can be expensive, especially if you&rsquo;re looking for centrally located hotels. To save money, consider staying in a hostel or a budget hotel outside the city center. Hostels can be found for as low as €15 per night, while basic hotels can be found for less than €50 per night.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re planning on staying in Rome for an extended period, consider renting an apartment. Airbnb is a great option, and you can find affordable apartments in the city center for as low as €50 per night.</p>
<p>Getting around Rome</p>
<p>Rome has an excellent public transportation system, including buses, trams, and a metro system. The metro system is cheap and efficient, with a single ticket costing €1.50. You can also buy a 24-hour ticket for €7 or a 72-hour ticket for €18.</p>
<p>Walking is also an excellent way to explore Rome, and many of the city&rsquo;s attractions are within walking distance of each other. Biking is another option, and you can rent a bike for around €4-€6 per hour.</p>
<p>Eating and Drinking in Rome</p>
<p>Food is an essential part of Italian culture, and Rome has some of Italy&rsquo;s best food on offer. However, eating and drinking in Rome can be expensive if you&rsquo;re not careful. To save money, avoid eating near major tourist sites, as the prices tend to be higher.</p>
<p>Look for trattorias and osterias in residential areas, as these restaurants are often family-run and offer excellent local food at reasonable prices. Consider ordering a pizza or pasta for lunch, as these are often cheaper than other dishes.</p>
<p>When it comes to drinking, avoid ordering a drink with your meal, as this can add up quickly. Instead, visit a local bar or enoteca and order a glass of wine or a spritz. You can also buy wine and snacks from a local supermarket and have a picnic in one of Rome&rsquo;s many beautiful parks.</p>
