However, it&rsquo;s the city&rsquo;s ability to bounce back that sets it apart. Despite being battered by nature, Houston has shown time and again that it has the strength and resilience to recover.</p>
<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll take a closer look at Houston&rsquo;s resilience in the face of natural disasters. We&rsquo;ll explore the city&rsquo;s strength and its ability to recover and rebuild. We&rsquo;ll also take a look at the top 10 tourist attractions located in Houston.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s History of Natural Disasters</p>
<p>Located on the Gulf of Mexico, Houston is one of the most vulnerable cities in the United States when it comes to natural disasters. Hurricanes are a significant threat, with Hurricane Harvey being the most destructive in recent memory.</p>
<p>In August 2017, Harvey hit the Houston area, causing widespread flooding and damage. The storm dumped an estimated 27 trillion gallons of rainwater on the region, which resulted in 82 deaths and more than $125 billion in damages.</p>
<p>But Harvey was not Houston&rsquo;s first brush with disaster. The city has a long history of weather-related events, including Hurricanes Carla, Alicia, Ike, and Rita, to name a few.</p>

<p>First responders, volunteers, and everyday citizens pitched in to help those affected by the storm. Boats were used to rescue people from flooded homes, and shelters were set up to provide temporary housing for those displaced.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s recovery efforts were equally impressive. While it will take years for some areas to fully recover, Houston has made significant progress. Damaged buildings were rebuilt, and flooded homes were repaired or rebuilt. Businesses reopened, and life in the city returned to normal.</p>
<p>Houston has also taken steps to improve its preparedness for future natural disasters. Infrastructure improvements have been made, and the city has developed a comprehensive hurricane response plan that emphasizes community engagement and education.</p>
