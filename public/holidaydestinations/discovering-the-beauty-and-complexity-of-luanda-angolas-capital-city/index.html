# Discovering the Beauty and Complexity of Luanda, Angola&rsquo;s Capital City</p>
<p>Located along the western coast of Africa, Angola holds the position of the seventh-largest country on the continent.

<p>Here is our guide to discovering the beauty and complexity of Luanda, Angola&rsquo;s Capital City.</p>
<p>## 1. Discover the History</p>
<p>Luanda&rsquo;s rich and storied past is evident in its many historical sites. The city is home to Fortaleza de São Miguel, built-in 1576 and currently serves as the National Museum of Slavery. Another impressive site is the Palácio de Ferro, built in France in 1890, and reassembled in Luanda in 1892. Today, it serves as an art museum where you can admire modern Angolan pieces.</p>
<p>## 2. Explore the Food Scene</p>
<p>Angolan cuisine is a fusion of local culinary traditions with Portuguese, Brazilian, and African flavors. Luanda boasts a robust street vendor scene, where you can find everything from grilled chicken gizzards to seafood stews. For a more formal dining experience, Luanda&rsquo;s restaurants serve a variety of dishes ranging from traditional fare like pirão and muamba de galinha to modern fusion dishes like guzzuzou.</p>
<p>## 3. Experience the Arts</p>
<p>Luanda&rsquo;s art scene is booming, with art exhibitions and festivals running throughout the year. One well-known art venue is the Belas Art Gallery, which showcases Angolan contemporary art, with a particular emphasis on highlighting the works of young and emerging artists.</p>
<p>## 4. Shopping in Luanda</p>
<p>Luanda&rsquo;s markets offer a taste of local life with goods ranging from local crafts to exotic fruits and vegetables. Roaming through the Handicrafts Market, City Market, or Roque Santeiro Market offers a great way to connect with locals, learn about the culture and history, and, of course, pick up a memorable souvenir.</p>
<p>## 5. Enjoy the Nightlife</p>
<p>Luanda&rsquo;s nightlife is a vibrant and energetic experience. The area around Marginal Avenue boasts several clubs, bars, and restaurants. Popular venues include Chillout, Salsa Coconuts, and Chillbar, which serve a variety of drinks and cocktails, catering to every taste.</p>
<p>## FAQ</p>

<p>**5. How do I get around in Luanda?**</p>
