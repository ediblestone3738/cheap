London Remains a Top Global Financial Hub Despite Brexit</p>
<p>London has long been recognized as the financial center of the world. It has a rich history of commerce and trade, and its location on the River Thames made it an ideal location for maritime trade. However, there has been much talk in the last few years about the impact of Brexit on London&rsquo;s financial sector.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty that Brexit has caused, London has remained a top global financial hub. In this article, we will explore the reasons why London continues to be a vital center for finance, as well as some of the top tourist attractions in London that can be visited while exploring this magnificent city.</p>
<p>London&rsquo;s Financial History</p>
<p>London&rsquo;s financial history dates back to the 19th century, when it became the center of the world&rsquo;s gold trade. During this time, the City of London became a hub for banking, insurance, and investment. Today, London continues to be the center of the world&rsquo;s capital markets, home to a wide range of financial services organizations.</p>
<p>Brexit and the Financial Sector</p>
<p>Brexit has caused some turbulence in the UK’s economy, but the city of London remains a financial hub. The UK officially left the EU on January 31, 2020, and entered a transition period until December 31, 2020, when the trade agreements were signed. In the past, the UK has been an attractive location for international financial institutions thanks to its stable economy, access to international talent, and legal frameworks.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty that Brexit may have caused, London remains an attractive location for financial firms, with its world-class infrastructure, highly skilled workforce, and established regulatory framework. However, many firms are now looking for ways to retain their access to the European market, which they previously enjoyed, and this will likely lead to some firms expanding their operations outside the UK.</p>
<p>Top 10 Tourist Attractions in London</p>
<p>London is a city that offers much more than just its financial sector. Here are ten of the top tourist attractions that you can visit while in London.</p>

<p>The Tower of London is one of the city’s most iconic landmarks. Built over 900 years ago, it has served as a royal palace, a prison, and a mint. Today, it is home to the Crown Jewels and a collection of arms and armor.</p>
<p>3. Buckingham Palace</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace is the official residence of the British monarch. It is open to the public during the summer months when visitors can see the State Rooms, which are used for official ceremonies.</p>

<p>The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel located on the south bank of the River Thames. It provides panoramic views of the city and has become one of London&rsquo;s most popular tourist attractions.</p>

<p>The National Gallery is an art museum that houses over 2,000 paintings. It includes works by some of the most famous artists in history, including Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent van Gogh, and Rembrandt.</p>
<p>7. St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral</p>
<p>St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral is an iconic landmark in London. It has been the site of many important events in the city&rsquo;s history, including the funerals of Churchill and the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana.</p>
<p>8. Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament</p>
<p>Big Ben is one of London&rsquo;s most famous landmarks. It is the nickname for the bell that chimes in the clock tower of the Houses of Parliament. The Houses of Parliament are home to the UK&rsquo;s government, and visitors can tour the building or attend a debate.</p>
<p>9. The Royal Observatory</p>
<p>The Royal Observatory is located on top of a hill in Greenwich, offering stunning views of the city. It was designed to be the center of the world’s timekeeping, and it is home to the Prime Meridian Line.</p>
