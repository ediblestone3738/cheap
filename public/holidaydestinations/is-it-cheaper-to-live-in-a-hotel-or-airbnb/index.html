<p>Are you planning a long-term stay or a trip with a large group of people? If so, you may be wondering if it’s cheaper to stay in a hotel or an Airbnb. The answer depends on a few factors, but generally speaking, Airbnbs are usually cheaper than hotels for longer stays and large groups.</p>
<h2 id="the-cost-of-hotels-vs-airbnbs">The Cost of Hotels vs. Airbnbs</h2>
<p>When it comes to cost, Airbnbs usually come out ahead. According to Sally French, a travel rewards expert who joined NerdWallet in 2020, “Airbnbs are usually <a href="http://localhost:1313/uncategorized/is-it-cheaper-to-upgrade-to-all-inclusive-at-the-hotel/" title="Is it cheaper to upgrade to all inclusive at the hotel?">cheaper than hotels</a> for longer stays and large groups.” That’s because you’re not paying for the same services that hotels offer, such as room service, daily housekeeping, and concierge services.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-hotels">The Benefits of Hotels</h2>
<p>Hotels offer a few advantages that Airbnbs don’t. For one, they usually have a more consistent level of quality. Hotels also tend to have more amenities, such as pools, fitness centers, and restaurants. And if you’re a frequent traveler, you may be able to take advantage of loyalty programs that offer discounts and other perks.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-airbnbs">The Benefits of Airbnbs</h2>
<p>Airbnbs offer a few advantages of their own. For one, they tend to be more spacious than hotel rooms, so they’re great for large groups. They also offer more privacy and a home-like atmosphere. And if you’re traveling with a pet, Airbnbs are usually a better option since many hotels don’t allow pets.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-saving-money-on-hotels-and-airbnbs">Tips for Saving Money on Hotels and Airbnbs</h2>
<p>No matter which option you choose, there are a few ways to save money. For one, you can look for discounts and coupons. You can also look for loyalty programs that offer discounts and other perks. And if you’re booking an Airbnb, look for listings that offer discounts for longer stays.</p>
