Las Vegas: The Entertainment Capital of the World</p>
<p>Welcome to Las Vegas, the city that never sleeps! Known as the Entertainment Capital of the World, it&rsquo;s no surprise that Las Vegas is one of the top tourist destinations in the United States. From the dazzling lights of the Las Vegas Strip, to the glimmering casinos, to the countless shows, attractions and fine dining options, there&rsquo;s no shortage of things to do in Vegas.</p>
<p>History of Las Vegas</p>
<p>But before we dive into all the exciting things that Las Vegas has to offer, let&rsquo;s take a brief look at the city&rsquo;s history. Although Las Vegas is now widely known as a gambling mecca, it wasn&rsquo;t always that way. Since its inception in 1905, the city relied heavily on the railroad and mining industries, until the state of Nevada legalized gambling in 1931. This change in legislation jumpstarted the development of the now-famous Las Vegas Strip, which is home to some of the most iconic casinos and hotels in the world.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Strip</p>
<p>Stretching over 4 miles long, the Las Vegas Strip is a world-renowned destination in itself. From the Bellagio&rsquo;s spectacular water fountain show to the Venetian&rsquo;s breathtaking indoor canal, the Strip is home to some of the most impressive and extravagant attractions on the planet. But if you&rsquo;re more interested in gambling, you&rsquo;ll find no shortage of casinos lining the Strip, including the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, the MGM Grand, and the Wynn.</p>
<p>Top 10 Tourist Attractions in Las Vegas</p>
<p>Las Vegas is bursting with activities and attractions, so where should you start? Here are 10 of the best must-see destinations in Sin City.</p>
<p>1. The Strip
As we&rsquo;ve already mentioned, the Las Vegas Strip is a must-see destination for anyone visiting the city. Make sure to check out the Bellagio&rsquo;s dancing fountains, the Mirage&rsquo;s Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat, and the iconic “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign.</p>
<p>2. The Mob Museum
For those interested in the darker side of Vegas history, The Mob Museum is a must-see attraction. Located in downtown Las Vegas, the museum explores the infamous criminal organizations that once controlled the city&rsquo;s casinos.</p>
<p>3. Hoover Dam
Just a short drive from Vegas, the Hoover Dam is an engineering marvel that&rsquo;s worth the trip. On top of marveling at the dam itself, take a guided tour to learn about its history and construction.</p>
<p>4. Fremont Street Experience
Skip the crowds of the Strip and head over to the Fremont Street Experience. Here, you&rsquo;ll find a large pedestrian mall with an overhead canopy that&rsquo;s home to a nightly light show. Plus, there are plenty of casinos, bars, and restaurants to check out.</p>
<p>5. Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area
If you&rsquo;re looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, head to the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. Here you can hike the trails, bike, rock climb, and more.</p>
<p>6. High Roller Observation Wheel
Although the High Roller Observation Wheel isn&rsquo;t the first of its kind, it is the tallest in the world. Take a spin on this 550-foot-tall Ferris wheel for unparalleled views of the city.</p>
<p>7. The Neon Museum
The Neon Museum showcases the vintage neon signs from Vegas&rsquo; history. Take a guided tour to learn more about the city&rsquo;s past and take in the colorful and iconic signs.</p>
<p>8. Bellagio Conservatory and Botanical Gardens
Step into a floral wonderland at the Bellagio Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. With five unique seasonal displays per year, this indoor garden is a must-see for anyone visiting Vegas.</p>
<p>9. Madame Tussauds Las Vegas
Get up close and personal with lifelike celebrity wax figures at Madame Tussauds. Pose for photos with your favorite stars and take in the incredibly realistic statues.</p>
<p>10. Mob Museum Underground Speakeasy
For something truly unique, check out the Mob Museum&rsquo;s Underground Speakeasy. This prohibition-era bar looks like something out of the 1920s, and offers craft cocktails and live entertainment.</p>
