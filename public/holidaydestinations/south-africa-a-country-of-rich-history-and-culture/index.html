<p>South Africa has a long and complex history. The first inhabitants of the region were the San and Khoikhoi people, who were hunter-gatherers. They were later joined by the Bantu-speaking people, who migrated south from Central and East Africa.</p>
<p>The first Europeans to arrive in the region were the Portuguese, who arrived in the early 1500s. They were followed by the Dutch in the 1600s, who established the Cape Colony in 1652. The British took control of the Cape in 1806, and the Dutch settlers, known as Boers, moved north to establish the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.</p>
<p>The Boers and the British fought several wars over the next century, culminating in the Boer War of 1899-1902. The British won the war and established the Union of South Africa in 1910. The country became a republic in 1961, and apartheid, a system of racial segregation, was introduced in 1948.</p>
<p>The apartheid system was abolished in 1994, and South Africa held its first democratic elections in 1994. Nelson Mandela was elected as the country&rsquo;s first black president, and South Africa has been a democracy ever since.</p>
