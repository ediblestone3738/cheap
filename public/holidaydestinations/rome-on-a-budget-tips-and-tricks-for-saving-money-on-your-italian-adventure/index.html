Rome is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, and it&rsquo;s not hard to see why. The Eternal City is filled with history, culture, and some of the most delicious food you&rsquo;ll ever taste. It&rsquo;s also notoriously expensive, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to break the bank to experience everything Rome has to offer. In fact, it&rsquo;s entirely possible to explore Rome on a budget and still have an incredible time. Here are some tips and tricks for saving money on your Italian adventure.</p>
<p>Tips and Tricks for Saving Money</p>
<p>1. Know When to Visit</p>
<p>The peak tourist season in Rome is during the summer months, from June to August. This is when the city is at its busiest, and prices for everything from flights to hotels are at their highest. If you&rsquo;re looking to save money, consider visiting during the shoulder season, which is from April to May and September to October. Prices are lower, and the crowds are thinner.</p>
<p>2. Stay Outside the City Center</p>
<p>Accommodation in the city center can be expensive, so consider staying in a cheaper neighborhood outside the center. The metro system in Rome is excellent, and you can easily get around to all the major tourist attractions. Look for hotels, hostels, or Airbnb&rsquo;s around the Termini station or Trastevere neighborhoods. These areas are more affordable and still have plenty of amenities.</p>
<p>3. Eat Like a Local</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that food is a huge part of the Roman experience, but eating out at restaurants can quickly add up. Instead, eat like a local and shop at one of Rome&rsquo;s many outdoor markets. You&rsquo;ll find fresh produce, meats, and cheeses at significantly lower prices. Additionally, street food is a fantastic option for budget travelers. Grab a slice of pizza al taglio, or Roman-style pizza by the slice, for a quick and affordable lunch.</p>
<p>4. Take Advantage of Free Activities</p>
<p>There are plenty of free things to do in Rome, and many of the city&rsquo;s biggest attractions are completely free. Take a stroll through the city&rsquo;s beautiful parks or explore the historic neighborhoods on foot. The Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and Spanish Steps are all free to visit, and you can spend hours admiring the stunning architecture and soaking up the city&rsquo;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>5. Use Public Transportation</p>
<p>Taxis in Rome can be expensive, so opt for public transportation instead. The metro system is efficient and affordable, and buses run frequently throughout the city. Purchase a day pass for unlimited travel through the city, or use a reloadable RomaPass card, which also gives you access to some of Rome&rsquo;s top attractions.</p>
