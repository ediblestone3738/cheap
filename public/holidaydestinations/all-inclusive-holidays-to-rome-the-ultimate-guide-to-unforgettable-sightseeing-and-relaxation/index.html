<p>1. The Colosseum: One of Rome&rsquo;s most iconic tourist attractions, the Colosseum is a must-visit for anyone travelling to the city. This impressive amphitheatre was built in 70-80 AD for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles. A guided tour will give you an insight into its fascinating history.</p>
<p>2. The Vatican Museums: Home to some of the world&rsquo;s most famous art pieces, including the Sistine Chapel and Michelangelo&rsquo;s famous fresco, the Vatican Museums should be at the top of your list. This is one of the busiest attractions in Rome, so booking an all-inclusive tour is highly recommended to avoid long queues.</p>
