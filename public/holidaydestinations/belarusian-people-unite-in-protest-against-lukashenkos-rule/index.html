<h1 id="belarusian-people-unite-in-protest-against-lukashenkos-rule">Belarusian People Unite in Protest Against Lukashenko&rsquo;s Rule</h1>
<p>Belarus, a small country in Eastern Europe, has been rocked by protests in recent months. People in Belarus have been protesting against the rule of President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994. The protests, which have been largely peaceful, have seen thousands of people take to the streets of the capital Minsk and other cities across the country.</p>
<p>The protests began in August 2020, when Lukashenko was declared the winner of a disputed presidential election. Opposition supporters and international observers have accused the government of rigging the vote and of widespread human rights abuses. The protests have been met with a heavy-handed response from authorities, with reports of police using violence, mass arrests, and even torture against protesters.</p>
<p>The protests have been driven by a sense of injustice and a desire for change. People in Belarus have been calling for Lukashenko to step down and for a new, free and fair election to be held. The protests have been widely supported by the international community, with the United Nations, European Union, and other countries calling for an end to the repression of protesters and for the government to respect the will of the people.</p>
