Get More for Your Euro: How to Plan a Budget-Friendly Greek Island Escape</p>
<p>Greece is a year-round destination, but its many islands make it particularly attractive during the summer months. As such, planning a budget-friendly Greek island escape is a popular pastime for travellers visiting the country. With its white-washed houses with blue shutters, stunning beaches, and delicious food, it&rsquo;s no wonder people want to visit these beautiful islands.</p>
<p>While Greece has its fair share of luxury resorts, you can actually plan a budget-friendly trip with a bit of know-how. Here are some tips for getting more for your Euro on a Greek island escape.</p>
<p>1. Choose Your Island Wisely
While each island has its own attractions, some are more expensive than others. Islands like Santorini and Mykonos are popular but come at a higher price tag. On the other hand, islands like Crete and Naxos are cheaper and offer visitors a more authentic Greek experience.</p>
<p>2. Plan Your Trip Ahead of Time
The earlier you book, the better the price you can get. Flight and hotel prices tend to skyrocket during the summer months, so it&rsquo;s better to plan well in advance.</p>
<p>3. Book Off-Season
If you can’t plan well in advance or have more flexibility, consider visiting during the shoulder season. Prices are lower, and the islands are less crowded.</p>
<p>4. Stay in Budget Accommodation
Accommodation will take up the majority of your budget, so it&rsquo;s important to find affordable hotels or hostels. Fortunately, there are plenty of budget-friendly accommodation options in Greece, ranging from guesthouses to apartments.</p>
<p>5. Eat Like a Local
Greek food is delicious, and eating locally is a great way to save money. Opt for eating at tavernas instead of fancy restaurants. You&rsquo;ll get the chance to try authentic Greek dishes while also saving money.</p>
<p>6. Rent a Car
If you&rsquo;re planning to explore the island, renting a car is a cheaper option than taking taxis or buses.</p>
<p>7. Take Advantage of Free Activities
The best things in life are free, and this is especially true on a Greek island. Spend your days lounging on the beach, hiking through the mountains or exploring the island&rsquo;s architecture and culture.</p>
<p>FAQs</p>
<p>Q. When is the best time to visit Greece?
A. June to September is the best time to visit Greece. The weather is hot, and the islands come to life with tourists. However, if you&rsquo;re looking for a budget-friendly trip, consider visiting during the shoulder season from April to May or September to October.</p>
<p>Q. Do I need a visa to visit Greece?
A. Citizens of the EU, US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand do not need a visa to visit Greece for up to 90 days. However, it&rsquo;s best to check with the Greek embassy in your home country to confirm.</p>
<p>Q. How do I get around the Greek island I&rsquo;m visiting?
A. Taxis are expensive on Greek islands, and public transport can be unreliable. Consider renting a car or scooter to get around the island.</p>
<p>Q. Is it safe to drink tap water in Greece?
A. Tap water in Greece is generally considered safe to drink, but bottled water is widely available if you prefer.</p>
