<p>What are the Visa requirements?</p>
<p>Visitors from most countries outside of the European Union require a visa to enter Cyprus. This can be obtained at the airport upon arrival.

<p>4. UNESCO World Heritage Sites - Cyprus has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the painted churches in Troodos, the Paphos Archaeological Site, and the Choirokoitia Neolithic Settlement.</p>
<p>5. Nissi Beach - This stunning beach is located in Ayia Napa and is loved for its crystal clear waters.</p>
<p>6. St. Hilarion Castle - This beautiful castle in Kyrenia is said to have inspired the castle in Disney&rsquo;s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</p>
<p>7. Aphrodite&rsquo;s Rock - This famous rock formation, located in Paphos, is said to be the birthplace of the goddess of love, Aphrodite.</p>
<p>8. The Troodos Mountains - This beautiful mountain range offers stunning views, great hiking opportunities, and a fantastic ski resort.</p>
<p>9. Cape Greco - This stunning natural park is located near Ayia Napa and offers beautiful views of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>10. Akamas Peninsula - This pristine peninsula is home to secluded beaches, ancient ruins and stunning landscapes.</p>
<p>What should I pack for a trip to Cyprus?</p>
<p>Cyprus is a Mediterranean island so light, comfortable clothing is suitable for most of the year. However, a warm jacket and sturdy shoes are recommended for winter months, especially if you plan to do some hiking or visit the Troodos Mountains. It is also recommended to pack some sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses for the hot summer months.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Cyprus is a must-visit travel destination filled with ancient ruins, natural wonders and beautiful scenery. It is a unique blend of culture, history and beauty that caters to all kinds of travelers from all walks of life.
