The Incredible Transformation of Bengaluru</p>
<p>Bengaluru, the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka, is a city that has undergone a remarkable transformation in the last few decades. Once known as the &ldquo;Garden City of India,&rdquo; it has now become a hub for business, technology, and innovation. Bengaluru&rsquo;s skyline is now dotted with high-rise buildings and its streets are flooded with people rushing to their workplaces.</p>
<p>In this travel article, we will explore the Incredible Transformation of Bengaluru, its most asked questions, and the top 10 tourist attractions located in the city.</p>
<p>The History of Bengaluru</p>
<p>Bengaluru was founded in the early 16th century and was ruled by many dynasties like the Vijayanagara Empire, Mughal Empire, Marathas, and the British Empire. Before the 1980s, it was just a sleepy town known for its pleasant climate, beautiful gardens, and a laid-back lifestyle, with a population of just a few hundred thousand.</p>
<p>However, with India&rsquo;s liberalization policies in the 1990s, Bengaluru emerged as a major destination for the IT and software industries. The city&rsquo;s climate, educated workforce, and affordable real estate attracted the attention of many multinational companies. The city&rsquo;s population exploded, from just over 1 million in 1981 to over 10 million in 2021, making it the third most populous city in India after Mumbai and Delhi.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Bengaluru</p>
<p>The transformation of Bengaluru has been dramatic. The city is now a thriving economic and cultural hub. It is home to some of the largest IT companies in the world, such as Infosys, Wipro, and TCS. The city has also become a center for start-ups, with over 8,000 start-up companies, making it the &ldquo;start-up capital of India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many new residential areas have sprung up in the city over the last few decades. Electronic City, Whitefield, and Manyata Tech Park are some of the most iconic ones. The city has attracted people not only from other parts of India but also from other countries. The result of this influx is a mosaic of different cultures and languages that has enriched the city&rsquo;s cuisine, arts, and customs.</p>
<p>The Incredible Infrastructure</p>
<p>Bengaluru&rsquo;s expansion has been accompanied by major infrastructural development. The city has a well-connected public transport system that includes buses, metro, and trains. The Bangalore Metro is the first metro system in India to have a purple line that connects east-west of the city, while the green line connects north-south. The city is also known for its massive flyovers that have eased traffic in the city.</p>
<p>The city has also become a hub for shopping and entertainment. The city has multiple malls like Orion, Mantri Square, and Phoenix Market City, which offer a one-stop-shop for everything from food to entertainment. The city also has many movie theatres and pubs that cater to a diverse clientele.</p>
