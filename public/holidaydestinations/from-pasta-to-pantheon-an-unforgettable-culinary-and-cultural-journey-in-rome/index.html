From Pasta to Pantheon: An Unforgettable Culinary and Cultural Journey in Rome</p>
<p>Rome, the eternal city, is one of the most visited destinations in the world. It’s a city filled with ancient history, spectacular art and architecture, and delicious cuisine. From the Colosseum to the Vatican, the city offers endless attractions to its visitors.</p>
<p>However, what makes Rome truly special is the combination of its culture and culinary traditions. It’s a city where you can take a walk through ancient ruins and end up tasting the most delicious pasta in a small family-run trattoria. So, if you’re a foodie and a culture enthusiast, then Rome is the perfect destination for you.</p>
<p>Here’s a guide to an unforgettable culinary and cultural journey in Rome, that will leave you with memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Day 1</p>
<p>Start your culinary journey in Rome with a classic Italian breakfast - a cappuccino and a cornetto. You can find these at any local café, or ‘bar’, like Caffè Greco in Via Condotti, famous for its aristocratic atmosphere.</p>
<p>After your breakfast, head to the famous market of Campo de’ Fiori, one of the oldest markets in Rome. Here, you can find a wide variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, and spices. Look for Pecorino cheese, olive oil, and Prosciutto di Parma, which are staples of the Italian cuisine.</p>
<p>Next, visit the Pantheon, a magnificent ancient temple that has survived the centuries. It’s an architectural masterpiece that’s revered for its perfect symmetry and engineering marvels. Don&rsquo;t forget to gaze up at the dome, which is an extraordinary sight.</p>
<p>For lunch, visit Roscioli, a deluxe delicatessen and restaurant that offers the best of Italian cuisine. Try their famous pizzas and homemade pasta dishes, paired with some of the finest Italian wines. It&rsquo;s worth noting that Roscioli doesn&rsquo;t take reservations, so potentially allow for a queue.</p>
<p>After lunch, a gelato stop is a must on any visit to Rome. Giolitti, near the Pantheon, is an excellent gelato parlour that has been around since 1890.</p>
<p>Day 2</p>
<p>Begin your second day by exploring the Vatican City, where you’ll get to marvel at the works of artists such as Rafael and Michelangelo. You can’t miss the St. Peter’s Basilica, the world&rsquo;s largest church, and home to some of the greatest masterpieces of art and architecture.</p>
<p>Later, walk towards Trastevere, a Bohemian neighborhood full of narrow streets, trendy bars and restaurants with a decadent atmosphere. Here, you can try the most authentic Roman pizza at Pizzeria Ai Marmi. Or try Cacio e Pepe or Amatriciana pasta dishes at Da Enzo al 29, one of the city&rsquo;s best trattorias.</p>
<p>Day 3</p>
<p>On your final day, visit the Colosseum, one of the most impressive architectural monuments from ancient Rome, which has survived 2000 years of history. An early morning visit is recommended to avoid the crowds. One of the best ways to experience the Colosseum is through a guided tour.</p>
<p>Next, take a stroll through the picturesque Trastevere district and explore the small artisan shops that sell traditional pottery, bags, and jewellery.</p>
<p>For your final meal, visit La Pergola, the three-Michelin-starred rooftop restaurant at the Rome Cavalieri Waldorf Astoria. The restaurant offers awe-inspiring views of the city and serves up some of the most delicious Italian dishes.</p>
<p>FAQs:</p>
<p>1. What’s the best time of the year to visit Rome?</p>
<p>The best time to visit Rome is between March and May, or between September and November, when the weather is mild, and the crowds are manageable.</p>
<p>2. What’s the best way to get around Rome?</p>
<p>The best way to get around Rome is on foot, as most of the monuments are in close proximity. However, the metro, buses and trams are also convenient and efficient, especially for travelling to areas outside the city centre.</p>
<p>3. What’s the dress code for visiting Rome?</p>
<p>There is no specific dress code for tourists in Rome, but it is recommended to dress modestly when entering churches and religious sites. Shorts, miniskirts, and sleeveless tops are often frowned upon.</p>
