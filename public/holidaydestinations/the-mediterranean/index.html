<p>The Mediterranean is a region that is rich in culture, history, and natural beauty. But as a traveler, it can be easy to get caught up in the well-known destinations like Santorini, Mykonos, and Ibiza. While these islands are undoubtedly beautiful, there are so many other lesser-known islands that are just as incredible, if not more so. In this post, I want to share with you some of the best kept secrets of the Mediterranean, and give you a guide to exploring these hidden gems.</p>
<p>First on our list is the island of Hydra in Greece. This tiny island is located just a short ferry ride from Athens, and it&rsquo;s a place that is often overlooked by tourists. But Hydra is a true gem, with its charming streets, white-washed houses, and crystal-clear waters. It&rsquo;s a place where you can truly escape the hustle and bustle of modern life, and it&rsquo;s a great place to relax and unwind.</p>

<p>When it comes to Greek islands, most people flock to the popular destinations like Santorini and Mykonos. But there is a hidden gem in the Saronic Gulf , and that is the island of Hydra. This small island is known for its charm, beauty, and tranquility, and it&rsquo;s a place that truly has it all.</p>
<p>Hydra is located just a short ferry ride from the port of Piraeus, and it&rsquo;s the perfect destination for those who are looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the mainland. The island is car-free, and the only mode of transportation is by foot or by donkey. This gives Hydra a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere that is hard to find elsewhere.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of Hydra is the Old Town, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Old Town is home to many charming houses, cobblestone streets, and traditional tavernas. As you explore the Old Town, you will feel as if you have stepped back in time. The highlight of the Old Town is the main square, which is surrounded by beautiful houses and is the perfect spot for people-watching.</p>
<p>Another highlight of Hydra is the island&rsquo;s beaches. Despite being a small island, Hydra has a number of beautiful beaches that are perfect for swimming, sunbathing, and relaxing. My personal favorite is Vlychos Beach, which is located just a short walk from the Old Town. This small pebble beach is surrounded by beautiful cliffs and crystal clear waters, and it&rsquo;s the perfect spot to escape the crowds.</p>
<p>Hydra is also known for its vibrant nightlife, and there are many tavernas and bars that are open late into the night. But if you&rsquo;re looking for something a little more low-key, then there are also many quiet spots where you can enjoy a drink or a meal while taking in the stunning views of the island.</p>
<p>When it comes to accommodations, Hydra has something for everyone. From luxury hotels to traditional guesthouses, there is a wide range of options to choose from. I personally recommend staying in one of the traditional guesthouses, as it&rsquo;s a great way to experience the authentic charm of the island.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Hydra is a hidden gem that is well worth visiting. This small island is known for its charm, beauty, and tranquility, and it&rsquo;s the perfect destination for those who are looking to escape the crowds and experience a more authentic side of Greece. I highly recommend visiting Hydra, and I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;ll fall in love with this charming island just as I did.</p>
<p>Next, we have the island of Menorca in Spain. This island is located just a short ferry ride from Mallorca, but it&rsquo;s a place that is often overlooked by tourists. But Menorca is a place that is truly worth visiting, with its beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and charming towns. One of the highlights of the island is the town of Ciutadella, which is home to a beautiful cathedral and a charming old town.</p>
<figure><img src="http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ciutadella-de-Menorca-Spain.jpg"
    alt="Ciutadella de Menorca, Spain" width="300"><figcaption>

<p>Menorca is one of the Balearic Islands located in the Mediterranean Sea, and it is often overlooked by tourists in favor of its more popular neighbors, Mallorca and Ibiza. But Menorca is an island that truly has it all, with its stunning beaches, clear waters, and charming towns. In this blog post, I will be sharing some of the hidden gems of Menorca that are well worth visiting.</p>
<p>First on my list is the town of Ciutadella, which is located on the western side of the island. Ciutadella is the former capital of Menorca and is known for its charming old town, which is filled with narrow streets, traditional houses, and beautiful plazas. The highlight of Ciutadella is the Cathedral of Menorca, which is located in the heart of the old town and is a must-see.</p>
<p>Next on my list is the Cova d&rsquo;en Xoroi, which is a unique cave located on the cliffs of the island. The cave is open to the public and is known for its stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea. The cave is also home to a bar and a nightclub, which makes it a popular spot for nightlife.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a more off-the-beaten-path destination, then the island of Es Grau is definitely worth a visit. This small island is located on the northeastern coast of Menorca and is known for its beautiful beaches, crystal clear waters, and charming villages. Es Grau is a great spot for swimming, sunbathing, and relaxing.</p>
<p>Another hidden gem of Menorca is the Torre d&rsquo;en Galmes, which is an ancient tower located on the southern coast of the island. The tower is open to the public, and the views from the top are truly breathtaking. The tower is also home to a small museum, which is dedicated to the history of Menorca.</p>
<p>Menorca is also known for its delicious food, and there are many traditional restaurants that serve delicious local dishes. The island is known for its seafood, which is caught fresh daily, and is a must-try when you visit.</p>
<p>When it comes to accommodations, Menorca has something for everyone. From luxury hotels to traditional guesthouses, there is a wide range of options to choose from. I personally recommend staying in one of the traditional guesthouses, as it&rsquo;s a great way to experience the authentic charm of the island.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Menorca is an island that is full of hidden gems. From the charming old town of Ciutadella to the unique cave of Cova d&rsquo;en Xoroi, there is so much to discover and explore. I highly recommend visiting Menorca, and I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;ll fall in love with this beautiful island just as I did.</p>
<p>Another island that should not be missed is the island of Elba in Italy. This island is located just a short ferry ride from the mainland, and it&rsquo;s a place that is often overlooked by tourists. But Elba is a true gem, with its beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and charming towns. One of the highlights of the island is the town of Portoferraio, which is home to a beautiful fortress and a charming old town.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have the island of Gozo in Malta. This island is located just a short ferry ride from Malta, and it&rsquo;s a place that is often overlooked by tourists. But Gozo is a place that is truly worth visiting, with its beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and charming towns. One of the highlights of the island is the town of Victoria, which is home to a beautiful cathedral and a charming old town.</p>
<p>As you can see, the Mediterranean is home to so many beautiful and lesser-known islands that are just waiting to be discovered. So next time you&rsquo;re planning a trip to the Mediterranean, make sure to take the time to explore these hidden gems. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed!</p>
