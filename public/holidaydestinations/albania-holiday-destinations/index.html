<p>Heading 1: Tirana - The Vibrant Capital</p>
<p>Tirana, the capital of Albania, is a bustling city with lots to offer. While it may not have the grandeur of some other European capitals, Tirana makes up for it with its vibrant atmosphere and colorful buildings.

<p>Heading 2: Berat - The City of a Thousand Windows</p>
<p>Located in central Albania, Berat is a historic town that has earned itself the nickname of &rsquo;the city of a thousand windows&rsquo; due to the many Ottoman-era mansions that line its streets. The town is situated on a hill overlooking the Osum River and is home to two impressive citadels - the Berat Castle and the Gorica Castle.
