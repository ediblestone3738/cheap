<p>Hotels and motels are a great way to stay when you’re travelling. Whether you’re on vacation or business, you can find a hotel or motel that fits your needs. But how long can you stay in a hotel or motel? The answer depends on the hotel’s policy.</p>
<h2 id="hotel-policies-on-maximum-stay">Hotel Policies on Maximum Stay</h2>
<p>Under hotel policy, guests at a residential hotel may stay at the hotel for months or years at a time so long as they leave their unit for 24 hours every 28 days. This is to avoid the guest becoming a permanent resident. California hotels and motels believe that by kicking out a guest for 24 hours before the guest stays for 30 consecutive days, they avoid the guest becoming a permanent resident.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-long-term-hotel-stays">What Are the Benefits of Long-Term Hotel Stays?</h2>
<p>There are many benefits to staying in a hotel for a longer period of time. One of the main benefits is the cost savings. Hotels often offer discounts for long-term stays, which can save you money in the long run. Additionally, you can often find hotels that offer amenities such as free breakfast, free Wi-Fi, and more.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-disadvantages-of-long-term-hotel-stays">What Are the Disadvantages of Long-Term Hotel Stays?</h2>

Hotels can be noisy and busy, and it can be difficult to find a quiet place to relax. Additionally, you may not have access to a kitchen or other amenities that you would have in a long-term rental.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-long-term-hotel-stays">Tips for Long-Term Hotel Stays</h2>
