US Increases Support for Syrian Opposition</p>
<p>The Syrian conflict has been one of the most devastating humanitarian crises of the 21st century. The conflict, which began in 2011, has resulted in the deaths of over 400,000 Syrians and the displacement of millions more. In response to this crisis, the United States has increased its support for the Syrian opposition. This article will explore the recent developments in US policy towards Syria and how it impacts the Syrian opposition.</p>
<p>Recent Developments in US Policy towards Syria</p>
<p>In April 2018, President Trump announced that the United States, along with France and the United Kingdom, had carried out airstrikes on Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government. The airstrikes were seen as a significant show of support for the Syrian opposition and a clear message to the Syrian government that the use of chemical weapons would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Additionally, the United States has provided significant financial and military support to the Syrian opposition. In September 2018, the Trump administration cut off all funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provided aid to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and redirected those funds to support the Syrian opposition. This move was seen as a clear demonstration of US support for the Syrian opposition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the United States has provided military assistance to the Syrian opposition through its military aid agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In 2017, the Trump administration authorized the provision of defensive weapons to the Syrian opposition, including anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft weapons. This move was seen as a significant increase in US support for the Syrian opposition.</p>
<p>How US Policy towards Syria Impacts the Syrian Opposition</p>
<p>US policy towards Syria has had a significant impact on the Syrian opposition. The increased financial and military support provided by the United States has given the Syrian opposition much-needed resources to continue their struggle against the Syrian government. The provision of defensive weapons has improved the Syrian opposition&rsquo;s ability to fight back against the government&rsquo;s military forces.</p>
<p>The airstrikes carried out by the United States and its allies in April 2018 were also seen as a significant boost for the Syrian opposition. The airstrikes demonstrated that the United States was willing to intervene militarily in support of the opposition and send a clear message to the Syrian government that their actions would not go unpunished.</p>
<p>However, the United States&rsquo; policy towards Syria has also been criticized by some as being too one-sided. Some critics argue that the United States has not done enough to address the humanitarian crisis in Syria and that more needs to be done to support Syrian civilians who have been affected by the conflict.</p>
