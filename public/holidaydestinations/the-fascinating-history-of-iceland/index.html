<p>The Settlement of Iceland</p>
<p>Iceland was first settled by Norse and Irish settlers in the late 9th century.

Iceland’s Commonwealth was then formed in 930 AD, and it was ruled under the Althing, which was the Icelandic Parliament.</p>
<p>Iceland’s Viking Age</p>
<p>The Viking Age in Iceland was a time of great change and expansion. The Icelandic sagas, which tell the stories of the great Viking heroes and their battles, are filled with stories of bravery and conflict. The most famous saga is the Saga of the Icelanders, the story of the early settlers and their descendants. The sagas are Iceland’s greatest contribution to world literature, and they have inspired writers from J.R.R. Tolkien to George R.R. Martin.</p>
<p>The Christianization of Iceland</p>
<p>In the year 1000 AD, Iceland converted to Christianity, and the country’s ancient pagan beliefs were replaced by a new faith. The conversion came after a long debate between pagan priests and Christian missionaries. It was said that the decision was made when a speaker at the Althing declared, “we will believe in one God, and his name is the Christian God.”</p>
<p>The Kalmar Union and the Danish Rule</p>
<p>In the 14th century, Iceland became a part of the Kalmar Union, which united Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Iceland was ruled by Denmark, and the Danish crown controlled much of the country’s affairs. This period of Danish rule lasted until the 20th century.</p>
<p>Iceland’s Struggle for Independence</p>
<p>In the 19th century, Iceland began to push for independence from Denmark. The struggle for independence was long and difficult, and it was marked by protests, demonstrations, and political turmoil. Eventually, in 1944, Iceland formally declared its independence and became a republic.</p>
<p>Iceland in the Modern Era</p>
