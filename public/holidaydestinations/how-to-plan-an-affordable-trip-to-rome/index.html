Rome is a city that has everything to offer to travelers. It is an art gallery presented in the open-air, a city of ancient history, and a modern cosmopolitan. Traveling to Rome does not have to be expensive; there are various ways to experience the eternal city without breaking the bank. Here is a guide to planning an affordable trip to Rome.</p>
<p>1. Travel during the offseason</p>
<p>Rome is an all-year destination; however, it is best to visit the city during the offseason. The high tourist season is from June to August, and the low seasons are from November to February. Accommodation, airfare, and tourist attraction tickets are significantly cheaper during the low seasons.</p>
<p>2. Find affordable accommodation</p>
<p>To find cheaper accommodation in Rome, opt for bed and breakfasts, hostels, or small boutique hotels. These types of lodging are much more affordable than fancy hotels, and they still provide comfort and convenience. The best areas to find affordable accommodation are near Termini Train Station, San Lorenzo, and Trastevere.</p>
<p>3. Use public transport</p>
<p>Public transport is an effective way to move around the city. You can purchase a Roma Pass, which offers unlimited travel on public transport as well as free entry to two museums and other discounts on tourist attractions. Alternatively, you can purchase a daily, weekly, or monthly transport ticket that allows you to use buses, trams, and metro.</p>
<p>4. Walk</p>
<p>Walking is a great way to explore the city and save money. Rome is a small city; it is possible to explore the popular attractions on foot. Not only is it cheaper, but walking also allows you to experience the city&rsquo;s sights, sounds, and smells.</p>
<p>5. Eat like a local</p>
<p>Avoid eating in the tourist traps and opt for local eateries. Roman street food is a must-try, and it is much cheaper than sitting in a restaurant. Try Suppli, a fried rice ball with tomato sauce and mozzarella, or pizza al taglio, a Roman-style pizza.</p>
<p>6. Visit the tourist attractions for free</p>
<p>Some of Rome&rsquo;s biggest attractions are free. You can visit The Pantheon, The Trevi Fountain, and The Spanish Steps for free. Additionally, all museums and galleries have free entrance one Sunday a month. You can also visit the Vatican City on a Sunday and attend the weekly Angelus prayer with the Pope, which is free.</p>
<p>7. Plan your budget</p>
<p>It is important to plan a budget for your trip to Rome. Rome does not have to be expensive, but it is easy to overspend on activities and food. Determine how much you can spend each day, and plan your activities accordingly.</p>
