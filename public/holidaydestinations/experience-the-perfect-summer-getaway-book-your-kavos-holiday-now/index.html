Summer is the perfect time to unwind and enjoy a well-deserved break from the daily grind. If you&rsquo;re looking for an ideal summer getaway, look no further than Kavos! This charming town located on the southern coast of the island of Corfu in Greece is the perfect destination for those seeking relaxation, beach fun, and a lively nightlife scene.
