Sail Away to Paradise: A Guide to Greek Island Hopping Holidays</p>
<p>Greece is known for its stunning islands, crystal-clear waters, and romantic sunsets. Beautiful beaches, stunning landscapes, and ancient ruins make Greece one of the most popular destinations in Europe. However, Greece’s islands are some of the world’s most idyllic getaways which make it an ideal destination for a sailing holiday. Set sail on a Greek island hopping experience that combines ancient history with the tranquil beauty that Greece is famous for.</p>
<p>With over 227 inhabited islands, island-hopping in Greece offers a seemingly endless selection of islands to choose from. However, it is often not an easy task to figure out which islands to visit and how to get there. Sail Away to Paradise is a guide for those who want to experience the Greek islands the traditional way, by sailing.</p>
<p>Getting There</p>
<p>The journey begins in Athens, where visitors can find marinas to rent a sailboat or book a sailing trip. A sailing holiday allows visitors to journey from one island to the next and explore Greece at their own pace. Island hopping can last anywhere from a single day to a month or more, depending on how many islands you want to see.</p>
<p>The best time to visit Greece is between mid-April to mid-June, and September to mid-October. During these periods, the temperatures are warm enough to sail and explore the islands, with fewer crowds than the peak summer season. However, the high summer season in July and August offers hot weather and a bustling nightlife.</p>
<p>FAQs</p>
<p>1. What do you need for a sailing holiday in Greece?</p>
<p>To have an enjoyable experience sailing in Greece, it is best to be prepared for variable weather conditions. Bring clothing that will keep you comfortable in the sun, wind, and rain. It is also important to pack sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses that will protect you from the strong Greek sun. You will also require a sailing license to operate a boat in Greece. If you don&rsquo;t have a license, you can hire a skipper.</p>
<p>2. How long should I spend in Greece?</p>
<p>The duration of your stay in Greece depends on how many islands you want to visit, and what activities you plan on engaging in during your stay. Usually, a two-week trip would suffice to visit several islands.</p>
<p>3. Is island hopping in Greece expensive?</p>
<p>Island hopping in Greece can be expensive, depending on the season and the type of accommodation you choose. However, the expenses can be managed by choosing budget-friendly options such as camping or hiring a sailboat with a group of friends.</p>
