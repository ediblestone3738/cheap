From Athens to Santorini: The Best Places to Visit in Greece this Summer</p>
<p>Greece is a stunning country that is well-known for its idyllic beaches, ancient ruins and fascinating culture. It is also one of the most visited countries in Europe, attracting millions of visitors every year. With its ancient historical sites and its breath-taking island scenery, Greece is a destination that should be on every traveler&rsquo;s bucket list. In this article, we will explore some of the best places to visit in Greece this summer, starting from Athens and ending in the beautiful island of Santorini.</p>
<p>Athens</p>
<p>As the largest city in Greece, Athens is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in history, culture, and architecture. The city is known for the Acropolis, the National Archaeological Museum, and the Ancient Agora, which are all major tourist attractions. The Acropolis is a complex of ancient buildings and temples, including the Parthenon, which is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. The National Archaeological Museum houses some of the most important artifacts from ancient Greece, while the Ancient Agora was the political and commercial center of Athens during ancient times.</p>
<p>Delphi</p>
<p>Located approximately 120 kilometers northwest of Athens, Delphi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is famous for its ancient ruins and breathtaking views. The site is home to the Temple of Apollo, which is considered one of the most important structures of ancient Greece. The Delphic Oracle, located in the Temple of Apollo, was consulted by ancient Greeks for advice on important issues. The site also includes a stadium that could seat up to 5,000 spectators, and the Treasury of Athens, a building that stored the city&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
<p>Meteora</p>
<p>One of the most stunning and unique destinations in Greece is Meteora, which is a complex of monasteries built on top of towering rock formations. The monasteries were built in the 14th century and were used as a refuge for monks escaping persecution during the Ottoman Empire. Today, the six remaining monasteries are popular tourist attractions that offer stunning views of the landscape.</p>
<p>Thessaloniki</p>
<p>The second-largest city in Greece, Thessaloniki, boasts a rich history, culture, and lively nightlife. The city has a number of historical sites, including the White Tower, which is a landmark of the city that was once used as a prison and torture chamber during the Ottoman period. The Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki houses collections of artifacts from ancient Greece and Rome, while the Byzantine Museum features a unique collection of Byzantine art, including icons and mosaics.</p>
<p>Halkidiki</p>
<p>Halkidiki is a region of Greece located in the northeast of the country. It is known for its stunning beaches, crystal-clear waters, and idyllic surroundings. The region consists of three peninsulas, each offering a different experience. Kassandra, the westernmost peninsula, is popular with tourists and boasts pristine beaches, turquoise waters, and lively nightlife. Sithonia, the middle peninsula, is quieter and more relaxed, with secluded beaches and unspoiled natural beauty. And Mt. Athos, the easternmost peninsula, is a monastic community that has been inhabited by monks for over 1,000 years.</p>
<p>Santorini</p>
<p>Santorini is a picturesque island in the southern Aegean Sea, famous for its volcanic landscape, white-washed buildings, and stunning sunsets. The island is also home to some of the best beaches in Greece, including Perissa and Kamari, which are known for their black sand. Oia, on the northern tip of the island, is one of the most popular destinations and offers stunning views of the caldera and the Aegean Sea.</p>
