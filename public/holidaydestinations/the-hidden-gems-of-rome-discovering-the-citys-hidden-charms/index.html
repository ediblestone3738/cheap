<p>Rome is a city that is almost too good to be true. From the world-renowned landmarks like the Colosseum and the Vatican Museums to the vibrant streets filled with countless pizza shops and gelato stands, the Eternal City boasts a vibrant energy that is hard to match.

In this article, we will take you through the hidden gems of Rome that will make you fall in love with the city even more.</p>
<p>Getting Off the Beaten Path</p>
<p>Rome can be an extremely busy and overcrowded place, especially during the peak tourist season. To get away from the crowds and to see the city&rsquo;s lesser-known side, be sure to avoid the most popular neighborhoods like the Pantheon or Spanish steps.

It offers a completely different atmosphere in comparison to the well-polished neighborhoods of Rome, and it comes to life even more during the evenings.
