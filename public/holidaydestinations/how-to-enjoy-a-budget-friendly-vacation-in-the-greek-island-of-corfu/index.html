Corfu is a popular Greek Island located in the Ionian Sea. The island is popular amongst tourists for its stunning beaches, buzzing nightlife, historic architecture, and natural beauty. However, a common misconception about the island is that it&rsquo;s expensive and only suited for luxury travelers. Fortunately, that&rsquo;s not entirely true as one can enjoy Corfu on a budget.</p>
<p>In this article, we will take a closer look at how you can enjoy a budget-friendly vacation on this Greek Island paradise.</p>
<p>1. Planning your visit: When planning your visit to Corfu, it&rsquo;s essential to keep in mind the high tourist season, which is typically from late June to early September. During this period, most hotels and resorts are fully booked, and prices are high. Therefore, it&rsquo;s advisable to visit during the shoulder months of May, October, and November when the crowds are fewer, and the prices are lower.</p>
<p>2. Choosing budget-friendly accommodation: Accommodation options are one of the significant expenses when traveling. However, Corfu has plenty of budget-friendly accommodation options to suit every traveler&rsquo;s needs. Hostels and guesthouses are ideal for budget travelers as they offer affordable rates, communal spaces, and a chance to meet fellow travelers. Airbnb is another great option, especially for those traveling in groups, as the prices are lower compared to hotels.</p>
<p>3. Eating on a budget: Corfu has an excellent selection of local eateries that serve authentic Greek cuisine at affordable prices.

<p>4. Transportation: Public transportation is a budget-friendly option for getting around Corfu. Buses and taxis are widely available, and the prices are reasonable. However, if you prefer to explore the island independently, renting a car or a scooter would be the best option.

The Palace was built in the late 19th century by the Empress of Austria and is now a public museum. Additionally, the Old Fortress in Corfu town, a.k.a. the Fortress of San Marco, is a UNESCO World Heritage site and offers stunning views of the island.</p>
<p>6. Fascinating Historical Places: Corfu also has many ancient historic places that are relatively cheap to visit. Arguably the most popular of these historical places is the Mon Repos Palace, located in the Kanoni neighborhood, which is a blend of Greek, French, and British architecture.
