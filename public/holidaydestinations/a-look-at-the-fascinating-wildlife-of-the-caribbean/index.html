<p>The Caribbean is a place of immeasurable beauty from its crystal clear waters, stunning beaches, and the wide array of marine creatures that inhabit the region. But, wildlife in the Caribbean also extends beyond the mesmerizing marine animals.

<p>If you&rsquo;re an animal lover or a nature enthusiast, the Caribbean is a must-see destination. The region is home to some of the most exquisite creatures on the planet, making it the perfect destination to behold and amble with the wild inhabitants. Here is a closer look at the fascinating wildlife of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Fauna in the Caribbean</p>
<p>1. The Green Sea Turtle</p>
<p>The Caribbean is a nesting spot for endangered Green Sea turtles, which always amaze visitors with their nesting behavior. When the female turtle lays her eggs, she will return to the same spot on the beach that she was born to reproduce. If you visit the Caribbean between May to September, you can witness first-hand the nesting process, as well as the baby hatchlings emerging from the nest and making their way to the ocean.</p>
<p>2. Manatees</p>
<p>Whether you see them swimming in groups, or resting along the shoreline, Manatees are a treat to behold. These harmless creatures have a gentle and docile temperament that will make you keep coming back for more. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough, you might even get a chance to swim with manatees in their natural habitat.</p>

<p>The Mona Monkey is one of the few natural inhabitants of the Caribbean, and they can be found in Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and some other islands. They are extremely playful and frisky, making them a favorite among visitors. However, it&rsquo;s important to remember these are wild animals, and they should not be fed or approached closely.</p>
<p>5. Iguanas</p>
<p>Iguanas are fascinating species of reptiles that can only be found in the Americas, and in the Caribbean. These creatures require a specific type of habitat, and the Caribbean is one of the few places that can provide it. Visitors can find iguanas in the forests or on the beach.</p>
<p>6. The Frigate Bird</p>
<p>The Frigate Bird is a fantastic bird species that can fly for months without rest, and they have the unique ability to capture water with their wings. Visitors to the Caribbean can view these birds&rsquo; nests on rocky islands, or while on a boat tour.</p>
