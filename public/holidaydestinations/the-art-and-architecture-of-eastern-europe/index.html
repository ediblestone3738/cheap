<p>The Art of Eastern Europe</p>
<p>Eastern European art is a diverse collection of styles and movements that flourished throughout centuries. The Byzantine style influenced much of the region&rsquo;s early art, leaving a lasting mark on the region&rsquo;s iconography. The medieval period also saw the emergence of Byzantine-influenced frescoes and murals, many of which can still be admired in churches and monasteries across the region.</p>
<p>The Renaissance brought with it the emergence of naturalism in art, a development that was reflected in the works of artists such as Jan van Eyck and Albrecht Dürer. In turn, the Baroque period influenced the development of ornate architectural elements, characterised by grand, over-the-top flourishes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous movement of Eastern European art is the Art Nouveau, which saw the emergence of elaborate, organic forms inspired by nature. This style spread throughout the region, especially in cities like Prague and Budapest, leaving behind iconic masterpieces such as the Municipal House in Prague and the Széchenyi Spa in Budapest.</p>
