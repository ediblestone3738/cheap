<p>Madrid&rsquo;s architectural heritage dates back to the Middle Ages when it served as the capital of the Spanish Empire. The city&rsquo;s historic center, also known as Madrid de los Austrias, boasts some of the most impressive landmarks and buildings of this era.

Built in 1778, this iconic monument features a beautifully sculpted facade with allegorical representations of war, peace, and the arts. From here, visitors can stroll down the Gran Vía, Madrid&rsquo;s main boulevard, lined with buildings constructed in various architectural styles, from Art Nouveau to Rationalism.</p>
<p>At the heart of Madrid&rsquo;s historic center lies the Plaza Mayor, a beautiful square dating back to the 17th century. Surrounded by elegant arcades and adorned with a statue of King Philip III, the square is one of Madrid&rsquo;s most popular tourist spots, home to numerous cafes, restaurants, and souvenir shops.</p>
<p>For those interested in exotic architectural styles, the Temple of Debod is a must-see. This ancient temple, which originally stood in the Nile Valley, was donated to Spain as a sign of gratitude for its assistance in preserving Egypt&rsquo;s cultural heritage.

Built in 1989, the building&rsquo;s futuristic design features cascading levels of terraces and a soaring atrium, housing millions of books and manuscripts.</p>
<p>At the edge of Gran Vía stands the Metropolis Building, a tall and imposing building decorated with ornate stucco work and crowned by a statue of the goddess of Victory. Once the headquarters of a major insurance company, the building now houses offices and shops.</p>
<p>Nearby lies the Bank of Spain, an imposing neoclassical building dating back to the early 20th century. Guided tours of the bank&rsquo;s museum offer visitors the chance to learn about Spain&rsquo;s financial history and admire its impressive architectural features, including a grand staircase and mosaic work.</p>
<p>Another notable monument is the Circulo de Bellas Artes, Madrid&rsquo;s most prestigious cultural center, housed in a magnificent building with Art Deco features. The center hosts numerous exhibitions, concerts, and literary events throughout the year, attracting artists and creators from around the world.</p>
