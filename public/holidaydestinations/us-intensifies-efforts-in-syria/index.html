US Intensifies Efforts in Syria: A New Frontier for Travelers</p>
<p>The conflict in Syria has been ongoing for almost a decade, and it has caused an overwhelming number of casualties, internal displacement, and destruction of infrastructures. The war has also created a power vacuum, which has drawn international involvement from both state and non-state actors. One of the most active participants in the conflict is the United States, which has launched several operations aimed at defeating the Islamic State (IS) and its affiliates. This article explores the US intensifies efforts in Syria and how it affects travel to the region.</p>
<p>Overview of the Conflict</p>
<p>The war in Syria started in 2011 when protests were held against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, demanding democratic reforms. The government responded with brutal force, leading to an armed uprising, which quickly grew into a full-blown civil war. In 2014, the Islamic State (IS) emerged as a major player in the conflict, capturing vast territories in Syria and Iraq. The US, along with the international coalition, launched a military campaign against IS in 2014, which led to the decline of the militant group.</p>
<p>As of 2021, the conflict is far from over. The Syrian government, with the support of Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, controls most of the major cities, while the opposition groups hold onto some areas in the countryside. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) control large swathes of territory in the northeast, including the strategic city of Raqqa, which was once the capital of the IS caliphate.</p>
<p>US Intensifies Efforts in Syria</p>
<p>The US has been actively involved in the conflict since 2014, focusing mainly on defeating IS and its affiliates. In October 2019, US President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of US forces from northeastern Syria, triggering a Turkish military offensive against the SDF. The move was widely criticized, and many saw it as a betrayal of the Kurdish fighters who had been the US&rsquo;s primary ally in the fight against IS.</p>
<p>Although Trump&rsquo;s decision was later reversed, the US has continued its efforts to stabilize the region. In December 2020, the US-led coalition against IS officially announced the end of its mission in Iraq and Syria, stating that the group had been defeated. However, sporadic attacks by the group and its affiliates continue to pose a threat to the region&rsquo;s stability.</p>
<p>The US&rsquo;s intensified efforts in Syria have seen an increase in military personnel and equipment deployed to the region. This has led to concerns among some that the US is seeking to establish a permanent military presence in the country. Additionally, the US&rsquo;s support for the SDF has also drawn criticism from Syria&rsquo;s allies, who see the group as a separatist movement that seeks to divide Syrian territory. Nonetheless, the US maintains that its support for the SDF is aimed at fighting IS and bringing stability to the region.</p>
