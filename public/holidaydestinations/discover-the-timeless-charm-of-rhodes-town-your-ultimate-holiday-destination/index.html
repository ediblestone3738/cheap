<p>Rhodes Town is one of the oldest inhabited cities in Europe and carries a rich history that dates back over 2,300 years.

In 408 BC, the island was conquered by the Persians and later by Alexander the Great in 333 BC. The island then fell into the hands of the Romans, and in 1309, it was taken by the Knights of Saint John, who built the magnificent medieval city and castle that still stand today. In 1523, Rhodes was conquered by the Ottomans and remained under their control until the beginning of the 20th century when it was absorbed into Greece.</p>
