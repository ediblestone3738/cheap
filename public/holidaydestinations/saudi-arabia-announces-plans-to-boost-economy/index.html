Saudi Arabia Announces Plans to Boost Economy through Tourism</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is the world&rsquo;s largest oil producer, but over the last few years, the country has shifted its focus to diversify its economy by investing in tourism. The kingdom aims to attract an average of 30 million tourists annually by 2030 as part of its Vision 2030 plan.</p>
<p>The government has announced a number of initiatives that aim to boost tourism in the country, which has been largely dependent on religious tourism. Saudi Arabia plans to introduce tourist visas, expand the number of tourist destinations, and develop infrastructure to support the tourism industry.</p>
<p>Tourist Visas</p>
<p>The most significant development in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s tourism industry is the introduction of tourist visas. In September 2019, Saudi Arabia announced that it would begin issuing tourist visas for the first time in its history. The visas are available in three main types: one-year multiple entry visa, 90-day multiple entry visa, and 30-day single entry visa.</p>
<p>The introduction of tourist visas in Saudi Arabia opens up the country to the world and is viewed as a significant step towards the development of its tourism industry. The visas effectively allow foreigners to visit the country for holidays, business or medical reasons, attend conferences or events, and visit family.</p>
<p>Developing Infrastructure</p>
<p>The government is making significant investments in the country&rsquo;s infrastructure to develop tourism. Saudi Arabia has ambitious plans to build mega-projects and expand airports, railways, and roads to support the tourism industry.</p>
<p>One of the most significant developments is the Red Sea Project, which is a $500 billion project that aims to transform 50 islands into luxury resorts. The project will create an estimated 70,000 jobs and is expected to attract up to a million visitors annually.</p>
<p>Tourism Destination</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is home to a vast range of tourist destinations, including natural wonders, historic sites, and modern attractions. The country is set to open up new tourism destinations to meet the demands of its growing tourism industry.</p>
<p>The Kingdom Tower in Jeddah is set to be the world&rsquo;s tallest building, reaching a height of more than 3,300 feet. The tower will contain a luxury hotel, residential units, and office space.</p>
<p>The Al Wahbah Crater is a natural wonder located in a desert area of Saudi Arabia, known for its elongated shape, which is filled with crystal-clear saline water. The crater is a popular destination for tourists interested in geology and outdoor activities.</p>
<p>The ancient city of Mada&rsquo;in Saleh is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is a must-visit destination for history enthusiasts. The site features the Nabatean tombs, which are carved out of sandstone cliffs and are some of the most impressive examples of rock tombs in the world.</p>
