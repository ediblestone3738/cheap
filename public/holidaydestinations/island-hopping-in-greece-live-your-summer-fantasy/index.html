Island-Hopping in Greece: Live Your Summer Fantasy</p>
<p>Greece is a dream destination for many travelers, and island-hopping is a perfect way to get a glimpse of the enchanting Greek lifestyle. There are over 6,000 islands scattered around Greece, but only about 200 of them are inhabited, offering endless possibilities for island exploration.</p>
