Here&rsquo;s all you need to know to experience the best Greek cuisine on your Rhodes holiday.</p>
<p>What Makes Greek Cuisine So Special?</p>
<p>Greek cuisine is a fusion of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavors and techniques, influenced by thousands of years of history. The Greeks were among the first to cultivate olives and grapes, and these ingredients form the basis of many Greek dishes. Herbs and spices like oregano, thyme, and mint are also used liberally, as are feta cheese, honey, and nuts.</p>
<p>Greek cuisine is known for its simplicity, using fresh and locally sourced ingredients to create dishes that highlight the natural flavors of the food. Recipes are often passed down through generations, and each region of Greece has its own specialties.</p>
<p>Rhodes is no exception, with its unique blend of Greek, Turkish, and Italian influences. Here are some of the top dishes to try on your Rhodes holiday.</p>
