Rome is undoubtedly one of the most spectacular and historic cities in the world. Known as the Eternal City, it is filled with stunning landmarks, ancient ruins, and incredible architecture. However, many people shy away from visiting Rome because they believe it’s too expensive. Fortunately, we have found some of the best deals for a budget-friendly Roman Holiday to help you discover all that this fantastic city has to offer without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Getting there</p>
<p>Before you start planning your Roman Holiday, you need to consider the best way to get there. Rome has two international airports: Fiumicino (Leonardo da Vinci) and Ciampino. Fiumicino is the largest and more central to the city, while Ciampino is smaller and less central. There are several budget airlines that fly to Ciampino, so it can be a good option if you’re on a budget. However, you’ll need to factor in the cost of transport to and from the airport, which can be around €30 each way.</p>
<p>Accommodation</p>
<p>One of the most significant expenses of any trip is accommodation. However, there are plenty of options in Rome that won’t break the bank. Hostels are an excellent choice for budget travelers, and there are many options available in central Rome. You can also find budget hotels or opt for Airbnb or serviced apartments.</p>
<p>Eating out</p>
<p>Italian food is world-famous, and what better place to sample it than in Rome? Eating out can be expensive, especially in the city center, but there are many budget-friendly options available. Trattorias and Pizzerias are often cheaper than their more upmarket counterparts, and street food is always a great option, too. You can also save money by eating a big lunch and a light dinner.</p>
<p>Getting around</p>
<p>Rome is a relatively compact city, and many of the popular tourist sites are within walking distance of each other. However, if you need to use public transport, the most cost-effective option is to buy a daily or weekly travel pass. These allow you to use buses, trams, and the metro for a set price, making it easy to explore the city without spending a fortune.</p>
