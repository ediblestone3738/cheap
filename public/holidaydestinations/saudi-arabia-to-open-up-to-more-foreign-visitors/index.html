Saudi Arabia, the largest country in the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a popular destination for Muslim pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. However, over the past few years, the Saudi government has been making efforts to increase tourism in the country and open up to more foreign visitors. In this article, we will explore the recent changes in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s tourism industry, answer some frequently asked questions, and share the top 10 tourist attractions in the country.</p>
<p>Recent Changes in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Tourism Industry</p>
<p>In September 2019, Saudi Arabia launched the &ldquo;Sharek&rdquo; visa program, which allowed tourists from 49 countries to apply for a visa online or upon arrival at any of the country&rsquo;s airports. This was a significant change as previously, the country only allowed entry to those who were on pilgrimage to Mecca or had business connections in the country.</p>
<p>In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Saudi Arabia suspended international tourism, but the country is now gearing up to restart its tourism industry with several new projects in the works. The government has committed to investing $64 billion in developing entertainment and tourism projects over the next decade, including a mega-resort on the Red Sea coast, an entertainment city near Riyadh, and a futuristic city called &ldquo;NEOM&rdquo; in the northwest of the country.</p>
<p>The Saudis have also been making efforts to improve the image of the country and its tourism sector. In 2019, they launched a new visa system that would allow women to apply for tourism visas without needing a male guardian. The government has also loosened some of the strict social codes that governed public life in the country, making it easier and more welcoming for foreigners to visit.</p>
<p>FAQs About Traveling to Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>1. Do I need a visa to travel to Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>Yes, tourists need a visa to travel to Saudi Arabia. The process is relatively straightforward, and you can apply online through the country&rsquo;s eVisa portal or upon arrival at any of the airports in the country.</p>
<p>2. Is it safe to travel to Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>Yes, Saudi Arabia is a relatively safe country to visit, with low levels of crime and terrorism. However, visitors should be aware that the country has different customs and laws than those in Western countries and should respect these cultural differences.</p>
<p>3. What is the best time to visit Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>The best time to visit Saudi Arabia is between October and March when the weather is cooler and more pleasant. However, the high season for tourism in Saudi Arabia is during the Hajj pilgrimage, which usually takes place in late July and early August.</p>
<p>4. Is alcohol allowed in Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>No, alcohol is strictly prohibited in Saudi Arabia, and the penalties for breaking this law are severe.</p>
<p>5. Can women travel alone in Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>Yes, women can travel alone in Saudi Arabia, but they must follow the country&rsquo;s dress code and cultural norms. Women are also required to have a male guardian if they are traveling to the country for work or relocating, but this does not apply to tourists.</p>
