Experience Rome on a Shoestring: Cheap and Cheerful Things to Do</p>
<p>Rome, the Eternal City, is one of the most visited cities in the world. The city is home to ancient ruins, cathedrals, museums, and art galleries, making it a treasure trove for culturally curious travelers. However, Rome can also be quite an expensive city to visit, especially for those who are on a tight budget. But, with a little bit of planning, it is possible to experience the best of Rome on a shoestring budget.</p>
<p>Here is a guide to experiencing Rome on a shoestring: Cheap and Cheerful Things to Do.</p>
<p>1. Take a free walking tour: There are many free walking tours available in Rome that will take you to some of the most popular attractions in the city. Some of the best tours include the Vatican City tour, the Colosseum and Roman Forum tour, and the Jewish Ghetto tour.</p>
<p>2. Visit the Pantheon: The Pantheon is one of the most iconic landmarks in Rome, and the good news is that it is completely free to visit. The Pantheon was originally a temple to all the gods of Ancient Rome, and it is now a church.</p>
<p>3. Explore Trastevere: Trastevere is a trendy neighborhood in Rome that is perfect for a leisurely stroll. The streets are narrow and winding, and there are many cafes and restaurants to explore, serving food and drink at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>4. Visit the Trevi Fountain: The Trevi Fountain is one of the most famous fountains in the world and is a must-visit attraction in Rome. While it is customary to throw a coin into the fountain for good luck, it is not mandatory.</p>
<p>5. Visit the Sistine Chapel: The Sistine Chapel is one of the most famous landmarks in Rome due to Michelangelo’s ceiling painting. Though a ticket to the Vatican Museums is required, there are days in the month when the Sistine Chapel is free of charge to all visitors.</p>
<p>6. See the Spanish Steps: The Spanish Steps is a popular tourist spot in Rome due to its history and grandeur. Climbing the steps is completely free, and from the top, visitors can enjoy a beautiful view of the city.</p>
<p>7. Visit the Roman Forum &amp; Palatine Hill: The Roman Forum is the center of ancient Rome and is home to some of Rome’s oldest ruins. A ticket that is in the range of 12-16€ (with reduced prices for EU citizens below 26 years old) provides visitors to the Roman Forum access to the Palatine Hill nearby which offers a sweeping view of the Colosseum.</p>
<p>8. Visit the Colosseum: The Colosseum is one of Rome’s most impressive landmarks, and a great place to visit on a budget. While there is an admission fee, the ticket includes admission to the Palatine Hill (combined ticket with Roman Forum) and is well worth the cost.</p>
<p>9. Enjoy the city’s gardens: Rome is home to many beautiful parks and gardens, including the Villa Borghese and the Gardens of Villa Doria Pamphili. While there may be a small fee to enter certain areas of the parks, these are some of the best places to relax and enjoy the city outside of the hectic crowds.</p>
<p>10. Visit markets and street food vendors: There are an abundance of food markets and street vendors in Rome where visitors can try authentic and delicious Italian cuisine for a fraction of the price of a sit-down meal at a restaurant.</p>
<p>FAQs:</p>
<p>1. What is the best time of year to visit Rome?</p>
<p>The best time to visit Rome is during the spring (March to May) or the fall (September to November) when the weather is mild and the crowds are fewer.</p>
<p>2. What should I pack for a trip to Rome?</p>
