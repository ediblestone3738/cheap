<p>2. Chasing the Northern Lights</p>
<p>Witnessing the Aurora Borealis is arguably the biggest draw for many visitors who come to Iceland.

Several tours are available that take you on guided expeditions to the best spots to witness the Northern Lights. Some tours even come with hot cocoa, and you&rsquo;ll find some delightful surprises on the way.</p>
<p>3. Soak in the Geothermal Springs</p>
<p>Iceland boasts over 160 hot springs, and the Blue Lagoon is the most popular of them all. The iconic pool is a geothermal wonder with mineral-rich waters from underground.
