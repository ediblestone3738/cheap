<p>The earliest inhabitants of Finland were the Sami people, who lived in the region for thousands of years before the arrival of other groups. The Sami were a nomadic people who relied on hunting and fishing for their sustenance. They also developed a unique culture and language that is still spoken today.</p>
<p>In the 10th century, the Vikings began to establish settlements in Finland. They were attracted to the rich resources in the region, including timber and fur.
