<p>Canada has a long-standing history of environmental protection. The country&rsquo;s first National Parks were established in 1885, and the government enacted the Forestry Act in 1869, making it one of the first countries to establish a forestry conservation program.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Canada established the Department of Environment, which oversaw the country&rsquo;s environmental programs, policies, and regulations. Since then, Canada has been committed to reducing emissions, preserving its natural landscapes, and protecting its biodiversity.</p>
<p>Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction</p>
<p>Canada has made significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2016, the government passed the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, which aims to reduce 2030 GHG emissions by 30% below 2005 levels.</p>
<p>The plan includes implementing a carbon pricing strategy, promoting cleaner transportation, and enhancing energy efficiency in buildings. Additionally, the government actively promotes the use of renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, wind, and solar.</p>

<p>Canada is home to some of the world&rsquo;s most spectacular natural environments, including vast forests, pristine lakes, and the Arctic wilderness. The country&rsquo;s national park system protects over 328,198 square kilometers of land, accounting for around 3.5% of Canada&rsquo;s landmass.</p>
<p>In addition to national parks, Canada has established protected areas and wildlife reserves to safeguard its biodiversity. These areas provide habitat for threatened and endangered species, such as the polar bear, wolverine, and woodland caribou.</p>
<p>Sustainable Practices in Cities</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s cities are also leading the way in sustainability. From bike-friendly infrastructure to green building initiatives, Canadian cities are making tremendous strides towards reducing their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>One example is Vancouver, which has set a goal to become the world&rsquo;s greenest city by 2020. The city has implemented policies to reduce GHG emissions, such as a zero-emissions building plan and an electric vehicle fleet program.</p>
