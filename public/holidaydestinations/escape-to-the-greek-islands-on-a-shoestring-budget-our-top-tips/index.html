Escape to the Greek Islands on a Shoestring Budget – Our Top Tips</p>
<p>Greece is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, and for good reason. The country is home to some of the most stunningly beautiful landscapes and unforgettable cultures in the Mediterranean. With pristine beaches, ancient ruins, and picturesque villages, Greece is a place where anyone can enjoy themselves. However, the cost of traveling in Greece can be high, especially during peak season. If you’re on a tight budget, don’t worry. Here’s a guide to escaping to the Greek Islands on a shoestring budget.</p>
<p>Tip #1: Choose the low season for your visit</p>
<p>Greece is packed with visitors during the high season of June to August. Therefore, if you are looking to travel on a budget, visit during the low season. The off-season runs from November to April, but from May to June and September to October you will still find some great deals.</p>
<p>Not only will you save on accommodation, but you will also avoid the crowds, and have a more enjoyable experience discovering hidden gems.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Take the ferry instead of flying</p>
<p>If you want to see several Greek Islands, the best way is to take the ferry. Ferries operate regularly between the islands, and the cost is cheaper compared to flying.</p>
<p>There are fast and slow ferries available depending on your budget. Some companies offer e-tickets, so it’s easy to book online before you arrive.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Stay in budget accommodation</p>
<p>Greece is an excellent destination for budget hostels and guesthouses as well as Airbnb. There are plenty of options to choose from and hostels allow you to meet other travelers. It’s also a great option for solo travelers who don’t want to be alone.</p>
<p>Tip #4: Cook your meals</p>
<p>One of the benefits of staying in a hostel or Airbnb is the opportunity to cook your meals. Greece has excellent markets with fresh produce. Buy some ingredients and cook delicious Greek dishes in your hostel’s kitchen. This alone can save you a lot of money!</p>
<p>Tip #5: Take advantage of free activities</p>
<p>Greece is a place where you can do plenty of free activities. You can explore the ancient ruins, visit archaeological museums, and go sightseeing for free.</p>
<p>However if you want to go on a paid tour, take advantage of discounts and visit museums, galleries, churches with a friend, or in a group.</p>
