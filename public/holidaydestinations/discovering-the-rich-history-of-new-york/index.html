<p>History of New York City</p>
<p>New York City&rsquo;s history dates back to the 1600s when it was first founded by the Dutch. Originally named New Amsterdam, it served as a trading post for fur traders. A few years later, the British seized the territory and renamed it New York in honor of the Duke of York.</p>
<p>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the city experienced significant growth and development, and its cultural and economic influence spread across the country and the world.

<p>Another must-see attraction is the African Burial Ground National Monument, located in the Financial District. It was rediscovered in the 1990s, and since then, archeologists have discovered over 400 skeletons of people of African descent who were buried there in the 1700s.</p>
