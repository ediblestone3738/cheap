<p>Exploring the Island&rsquo;s Rich History</p>
<p>Santorini, also known as Thira, has a rich history that dates back to the Bronze Age. The island&rsquo;s unique geological features have played a significant role in shaping its history.

The eruption also led to the end of the Minoan civilization, which was located on the island of Crete.</p>
<p>Santorini was re-inhabited by the Phoenicians in the 9th century BC and later by the Dorians. The island came under the rule of the Byzantine Empire in the 4th century AD, followed by the Venetians and the Ottomans.
