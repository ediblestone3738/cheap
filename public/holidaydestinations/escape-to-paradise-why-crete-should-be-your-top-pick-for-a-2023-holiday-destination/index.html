<p>Delicious Cuisine</p>
<p>Greek cuisine is known for its fresh ingredients and delicious flavors, and Crete is no exception. The island&rsquo;s cuisine is inspired by its Mediterranean location and includes dishes like tzatziki, moussaka, and fresh seafood.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional Greek dishes, Crete has its own unique cuisine, which includes dishes like dakos, a salad made with barley rusks, tomatoes, and feta cheese, and apaki, which is smoked pork.</p>
<p>Hiking and Outdoor Activities</p>
<p>Crete is a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts. The island has many hiking trails that offer stunning views of the coastline and mountains. One of the most popular hikes is the Samaria Gorge, which is a 16-kilometer-long trail that takes you through a stunning gorge and ends at the sea.</p>
