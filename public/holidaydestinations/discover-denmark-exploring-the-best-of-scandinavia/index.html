<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-best-time-to-visit-denmark">What is the best time to visit Denmark?</h3>
<p>The best time to visit Denmark is during the summer months of June to August when the weather is at its warmest and daylight hours are longest. However, this is also the busiest time of the year, and prices for accommodation and attractions tend to be higher. Spring and fall can be lovely times to visit as well, with fewer crowds and milder weather.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-currency-used-in-denmark">What is the currency used in Denmark?</h3>
<p>The currency used in Denmark is the Danish Krone (DKK). At the time of writing, 1 USD is roughly equivalent to 6.4 DKK.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-need-a-visa-to-visit-denmark">Do I need a visa to visit Denmark?</h3>
<p>If you are a citizen of the EU, EEA, or Switzerland, you do not need a visa to enter Denmark. Citizens of many other countries, including the US, Canada, and Australia, can enter Denmark for tourism purposes without a visa for up to 90 days.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-official-language-of-denmark">What is the official language of Denmark?</h3>
<p>The official language of Denmark is Danish, but English is widely spoken and understood throughout the country. Many locals also speak German or a Scandinavian language like Swedish or Norwegian.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-food-like-in-denmark">What is the food like in Denmark?</h3>
<p>Danish cuisine is known for its hearty, traditional dishes like smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches), fish dishes, and meatballs. The country is also famous for its beer and desserts like æbleskiver (apple pancakes) and flødeboller (chocolate-covered marshmallow treats).</p>
<h3 id="is-denmark-an-expensive-country-to-visit">Is Denmark an expensive country to visit?</h3>
<p>Denmark can be quite expensive compared to many other European countries, especially when it comes to accommodation and dining out. However, it&rsquo;s possible to find budget-friendly options if you do your research and plan ahead. Many attractions and museums offer free admission, and staying outside of major cities can often save you money on accommodation.</p>
