<p>Geography and Overview</p>
<p>Micronesia is a vast archipelago that encompasses the Western Pacific Ocean. The region comprises four distinct island groups: the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>Each island group has its own unique culture, language, and traditions. However, despite their differences, they all share a common history of colonialism, war, and occupation. The legacy of this turbulent history can still be seen in the region&rsquo;s art, architecture, and traditional customs.</p>
<p>The Federated States of Micronesia is a sovereign nation that includes four states: Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae. The capital city is Palikir, located on the island of Pohnpei. The country is known for its abundant biodiversity, pristine beaches, and rich cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The Republic of the Marshall Islands consists of 29 atolls and five individual islands. The capital city is Majuro, located on the island of Majuro. The country is known for its stunning coral reefs, diverse marine life, and unique cultural traditions.</p>
<p>The Republic of Palau includes over 340 islands and is located midway between Guam and the Philippines. The capital city is Ngerulmud, located on the island of Babeldaob. The country is renowned for its turquoise waters, pristine white sandy beaches, and rich marine biodiversity.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a territory of the United States that includes 14 islands. The capital city is Saipan, located on the island of Saipan. The country is known for its stunning beaches, scenic mountain ranges, and rich cultural history.</p>
