Rome City Breaks: Discover the Eternal City&rsquo;s Hidden Gems</p>
<p>Rome is not only the capital of Italy, but it&rsquo;s also an ancient city that has played an essential role in the development of Western culture. It&rsquo;s a city that boasts historic landmarks, art masterpieces, and architectural marvels that span over two millennia. Indeed, Rome delivers the goods to every type of traveler, from history buffs to foodies, and everyone in between. If you&rsquo;re planning a trip to Rome, here are a few places and things to discover for your perfect city break.</p>
<p>Getting Around Rome</p>
<p>The best way to explore Rome is on foot. Rome has a compact city center, and most of the city&rsquo;s fantastic landmarks are located close to each other. However, if you&rsquo;re tired after a long walk, don&rsquo;t worry. Rome also has a well-connected subway system that can take you to the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>Hopping on a Taxis in Rome is also an easy way to navigate the city streets. However, be careful about fare costs - unscrupulous taxi drivers can charge high prices for tourists.</p>
<p>If you want a more authentic Roman experience, consider renting a bike or scooter. It is also an excellent way to explore the city&rsquo;s suburbs, which are a bit more difficult to navigate on foot.</p>
<p>Best Time to Visit Rome</p>
<p>Rome is lovely at any time of the year, and it is one of the few destinations that can be visited all year round. The summer months, June to August, are the busiest times of the year, and temperatures can be extremely hot, which can hinder your explorations around the city.</p>
<p>Visiting Rome from September through November offers the best climate, allowing visitors to enjoy largely mild weather. From December through to February, the winter months, temperatures get low enough to enjoy winter-sports in the surrounding hills, but can be chilly on the streets, which makes exploring the city less appealing. Late February to May is also a great time to visit, offering mild days before the summer heat sets in.</p>
<p>Hidden Gems in Rome</p>
<p>Navigating the streets of Rome, you&rsquo;ll quickly discover the city is filled with hidden gems. Here are some of our favorites:</p>
<p>Piazza Navona - This Piazza developed from the ruins of the Domitian stadium is a must-see with its fountains and outdoor cafes.</p>
<p>Pantheon - One of the most well-preserved pillars of Ancient Rome, this iconic building is over 2,000 years old, and it&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t miss.</p>
<p>Villa Borghese - Exploring this park, the largest public green space in Rome, will take you through gardens, galleries and museums, and even a lake with a temple on an island.</p>
<p>Ponte Milvio - Located near the Rome Olympic Village, the Popolo Bridge is famous for being the oldest bridge in Rome.</p>
<p>Monti District - The historic Monti quarter is a great spot to visit and relax with numerous quaint cafes and chic boutiques aimed at the local bohemian clique.</p>
