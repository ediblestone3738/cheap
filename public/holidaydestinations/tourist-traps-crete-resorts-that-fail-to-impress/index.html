Tourist Traps: Crete Resorts That Fail To Impress</p>
<p>Crete is a beautiful island located in Greece, with a diverse landscape of stunning beaches, rugged mountains, and fascinating archaeological sites. It is a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year. Unfortunately, some of the resorts on the island have failed to impress tourists due to a variety of reasons. In this article, we will cover some of these tourist traps and provide some tips on how to avoid them.</p>
<p>Reasons Why Some Crete Resorts Fail to Impress Tourists</p>
<p>1. Overcrowding: One of the main issues is the overcrowding of the resorts. During peak season, the beaches and other tourist areas can get extremely crowded, making it difficult to relax and enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>2. Poor service: Another major complaint from tourists is poor service in some of the resorts. This can range from rude staff to slow service in restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>3. Lack of authenticity: Some of the resorts on the island have been developed purely for tourists and lack any authentic Greek culture or character.</p>
<p>4. High prices: Some tourists have found that the prices in certain resorts are much higher than expected, especially in restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>5. Poor hygiene: Some resorts have been criticized for poor hygiene standards, especially in the bathrooms, which can be a major issue for visitors.</p>
<p>Tips to Avoid Tourist Traps in Crete Resorts</p>
<p>1. Visit during the off-season: One of the best ways to avoid the crowds is to visit during the off-season. This can mean cheaper prices, less crowded beaches, and a more relaxed atmosphere.</p>
<p>2. Research your resort before booking: It’s important to research your resort before booking to avoid any unpleasant surprises. There are plenty of websites and forums where tourists can find reviews of resorts and get an idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>3. Choose a more authentic resort: If you want to experience more of the local culture, it’s best to choose a resort that is not solely focused on tourists. These resorts are more likely to have a unique character and local charm.</p>
<p>4. Check hygiene standards: When choosing a resort, it’s important to check the hygiene standards, especially if you are traveling with children. Reading reviews and checking ratings can help give you peace of mind.</p>
<p>5. Beware of hidden costs: Some resorts have been known to charge extra for things such as sunbeds, towels, and water sports activities. It’s important to be aware of these extra costs so you can factor them into your budget.</p>
<p>FAQs</p>

<p>A: The best times to visit Crete are during the shoulder seasons, which are April to June and September to October. The temperatures are still warm, and the crowds are smaller.</p>
<p>Q: What is the best way to get around Crete?</p>
<p>A: The best way to get around Crete is by renting a car. This will give you more flexibility and allow you to explore the island at your own pace.</p>
