Nice is the perfect destination for a city break.

If you&rsquo;re planning a trip to Nice but aren&rsquo;t sure what to do or see, then this guide is for you.</p>

<p>Accommodation</p>
<p>Nice is well served by accommodation options with something to suit every type of traveler. From luxury to budget-friendly hotels, charming Airbnbs and self-catering apartments, and boutique guesthouses overlooking the sea.</p>
<p>Whatever type of accommodation you&rsquo;re looking for, you&rsquo;ll be able to find it in Nice. A popular area to stay in is the Old Town with its vibrant atmosphere, artsy shops, bars and restaurants, while the Promenade des anglais is best for sea view hotels.</p>
<p>Top 10 Tourist Attractions in Nice</p>

<p>Place Massena is Nice’s grandest square and is pedestrianized, so you can wonder about freely, taking in the hustle and bustle of the city. It’s flanked by stunning architecture, fountains and historical buildings.</p>
<p>4. Castle Hill</p>
<p>Climbing to the top provides amazing views of the sea, the city below and the port at the distance. You can either take the stairs or use the lift (costs a few Euros). It is worth the visit.</p>
<p>5. Musée Matisse</p>
<p>Opened in 1963, the museum is home to one of the most comprehensive collections of French artist Henri Matisse – the blissful display of art is a sight to behold, including his most famous creations like “Purple Robe and Anemones.”</p>
<p>6. Musée Marc Chagall</p>
<p>More than 230 works by the Russian painter can be found in the museum, which was designed to resemble the Biblical temple of Jerusalem. Don’t miss the stunning ceiling mural- “The Message of peace” series.</p>
<p>7. Phoenix Park</p>
<p>Phoenix Park, located west of Nice, houses over 2,500 species of plants and animals including penguins, pelicans, and flamingos. Watch the parrots fly during the bird show and admire plant life from anywhere around the world.</p>
<p>8. The Cimiez Monastery</p>
<p>Located in the Cimiez neighborhood, the Franciscan Monastery of Cimiez is steeped in history and is where the Monks have resided for over five centuries. It’s also a concert venue worth attending.</p>
