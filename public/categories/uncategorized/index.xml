Generally speaking, plane tickets usually don&amp;rsquo;t get cheaper closer to the departure date. Instead, flights tend to be the most inexpensive when you book between four months and three weeks before your departure date. According to CheapAir.com, you can expect rates to go up after that period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The answer is yes! TUI, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading travel companies, has a value guarantee that applies to all of their excursions. If a guest receives the exact same excursion from another provider at a better price, TUI will refund the difference between the two offers. This value guarantee applies regardless of whether the customer has booked the excursion in advance at a travel agency, with a local rep or online.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is because the law states that all employees, regardless of their working hours, should receive the same holiday entitlement as their full-time colleagues. This means that if you work part-time, you are entitled to the equivalent number of days holiday (including bank holidays) in proportion to the hours you work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
