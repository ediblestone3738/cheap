<p>Jamaica is a beautiful island nation in the Caribbean Sea. It is a popular tourist destination, known for its stunning beaches, lush rainforests, and vibrant culture. However, Jamaica is also located in the Atlantic hurricane belt, which means that it is at risk of being hit by hurricanes.</p>

<p>If you are planning a trip to Jamaica during hurricane season, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, it is important to have a plan in place in case a hurricane strikes.
